<p>Published on 2016-04-10 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-9927"><span class="std std-ref">Tote HaD</span></a>.</p>
<p>The robots are built, but due to a bug in the communication code, they
didn’t walk “straight out of the box”. The bug makes them wait for a
connection before they start walking, and I will be fixing this soon,
and I will provide new firmware to flash soon.</p>
<p>In the mean time, you can play with your robots by using a serial
connection. In fact, you will have access to the Python console on
them. All you need is a 3.3V USB2TTL converter (I gave out a couple at
the workshop, it’s that red thing with USB plug on it). If you don’t
have one, I highly recommend you get it anyways, because they are
extremely useful in debugging all sorts of projects anyways, and you
will also need to to flash the new firmware, both for the Arduino and
the ESP8266 parts of the robot.</p>
<section id="connecting">
<h2>Connecting<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To connect the serial interface of the ESP8266  on your robot to your
computer, you will need to use the three pins on the left side of the
robots. If you look at the bottom side of the board, you will see they
are labeled, from front to back, “gnd”, “tx” and “rx”. Use three
female-female dupont cables, and connect the “gnd” pin on the robot
with the “gnd” pin on the USB2TTL, the “rx” pin of the robot with the
“tx” pin on the USB2TTL, and the “tx” pin on the robot with the “rx”
pin on the USB2TTL.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>gnd ↔ gnd</p></li>
<li><p>rx ↔ tx</p></li>
<li><p>tx ↔ rx</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, plug the USB2TTL into your computer (or even better, a USB hub
connected to your computer), and open a serial terminal with speed
115200 on the serial port that appears. On Linux, I use the_screen_ program for that, with the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 <span class="m">115200</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On Windows you can use PuTTY for that (you might need to have the
drivers for the USB2TTL installed first). I have no idea how to do
that on macs, but there must be some way. Once you do that, you should
see black screen… Then switch on the robot, and you should see
something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>rll��|�l�|�l�b|����r�b�b��nn�lnn���bplblrlp�n��lbn�|쌌��b��nn�l��l`�nnl`nr���nr�`p�n�r�����bn�|lb��nn�l`�nnl`nr���nrrl`p�n�r�����쌜bn�|쌎b��nn�l`�nnl`nr���nl`r��nl`�l��|��rrnb��l��b�lb쌜���l��b�lrldon&#39;t use rtc mem data
ll��|��rrnb��ll�p�b�b쌜���l��b��lrl�l��|��rrnb��ll�|�b�b쌜����b�lblrl��rl���bl�br|�bll���lb��n�nn��l�|�l�l��l������l`�n��
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That’s the booting messages of the ESP8266 received at a wrong baud
rate. Don’t worry about that. Now, if you press Ctrl+C, the program
that is executing on the robot will be interrupted, and you will see
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">MicroPython</span> <span class="n">v1</span><span class="mf">.6</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">374</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">g2c407bc</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dirty</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="mi">2016</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">04</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">07</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">ESP</span> <span class="n">module</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">ESP8266</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That’s the Python console prompt, also known as the REPL console. You
can type Python code in there, and it will get executed on the robot.</p>
</section>
<section id="walking">
<h2>Walking<a class="headerlink" href="#walking" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>So how do you make it walk? Type in this code:</p>
<div class="highlight-hljs notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>from robot import Robot
from gait import Creep
robot = Robot()
gait = Creep(robot)
for frame in gait.run():
    pass

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That should get the robot creeping forward. To change the directions
you can set the_dx_,<em>dy</em> and_rotation_ attributes on the_gait_ object, and repeat the_for_ loop.</p>
</section>
<section id="network">
<h2>Network<a class="headerlink" href="#network" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default the robot will create its own network, and act as an access
point – that’s because I didn’t know what networks will be available
at the conference, and of course I wanted the robots to still work
after you have taken them home. Unfortunately, when I tested the code,
I did it with the robot connected to my home network, for convenience.
That’s how the bug crept in – I didn’t test it in the access point
mode, just assumed it would work the same way.</p>
<p>But that means that you should be able to work around the bug by
connecting the robot to your home network. Here is how to do it.
First, disable the “access point” interface:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">network</span>
<span class="n">network</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">WLAN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">network</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">AP_IF</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">active</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">False</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then enable the “station” interface:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">wlan</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">network</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">WLAN</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">network</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">STA_IF</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">wlan</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">active</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then make it connect to your network:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">wlan</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;ssid&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;password&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The robot will remember this, and will re-connect to that network
automatically on every boot from now on.</p>
</section>
<section id="remote-control">
<h2>Remote Control<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-control" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The robot has very simple remote control through WiFi for now. Once
you restart it, you should be able to connect to it on port 1010 with
Telnet or Netcat, and send it “wasd” letters for arrows, and space for
“stop”. Depending on the program you use, you might need to press
enter after each of the letters. To simplify that, there is a <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote-had/src/3b9ed9cd63ef32b42fe25f71586ff048a9bacf60/client.py">client.py</a>  program in the repository, which uses PyGame to read the arrow
keypresses, and sends them to the robot. You run it with the IP
address of the robot as the first argument.</p>
</section>
<section id="moving-individual-legs">
<h2>Moving Individual Legs<a class="headerlink" href="#moving-individual-legs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There isn’t much other functionality implemented yet, but if you want,
you can make the robot move its legs however you want from Python, and
even make it dance or do something else… You can do it using the
“robot” object above. For instance, to make the front left leg move
20mm forward and 10mm up, you would do:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">robot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">legs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">move_to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">robot</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The “update” step is where the command is actually sent to the servos.
The coordinate system for the legs is simple: X axis is left-right,
with negative numbers being closer to the body, and positive numbers
further from it. The Y axis is front-back, with positive numbers being
forward, and negative – backward. The Z axis is up-down, with
positive being down, and negative – up. The (0, 0, 0) position is the
robot’s starting position, with all servos centered.</p>
</section>
<section id="updates">
<h2>Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#updates" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I will definitely fix the bug, and maybe even figure a better way to
control the robot remotely. When I do, the new firmware and
instructions for flashing it will be available here on this project
page. I will also make updates as the amazing developers of
Micropython add more features to it. At the moment they are working on
a web-based interactive Python console, including file upload, which
should make hacking on this robot super-convenient. However, this is
all still in the alpha stage of development at the moment, so we will
have to make do with what we have now.</p>
