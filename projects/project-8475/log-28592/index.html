<p>Published on 2015-12-02 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-8475"><span class="std std-ref">Micro:bot</span></a>.</p>
<p>I knew what I wanted to do with the micro:bit – I wanted to put it
into robots and program them in Python. So I decided to start with the
simplest thing possible – a two-wheeled robot, with continuous
rotation servos and a caster wheel. I only had two criteria for
choosing the parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I had to have them already, because I only had a few days, and they
had to be off the shelf – no salvaged or custom-made stuff, so that
it can be replicated easily.</p></li>
<li><p>No soldering, laser-cutter, 3d-printer etc. Just two-sided tape and
some glue.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I started by gluing everything together with the two-sided tape in
several different configurations. At the beginning, I didn’t have the
white depron bar to hold the screws, so I simply hotglued them to the
servos:</p>

<p>This is actually the only interface the robot has with the micro:bit,
because I didn’t have the edge connector for accessing all the other
pins yet. But three pins is enough for me – two for the servos, and
one for the distance sensor.</p>
<p>After assembling and testing it with some simple code, I noticed that
the servos have a lot of problems with the PWM signal generated by the
micro:bit. They would basically rotate at maximum speeds in random
directions… So I went to the nearby hackerspace and used their
oscilloscope to look at the signal. Turns out that you have to set the
frequency of the PWM signal several times for it to have the desired
effect. After just one time, the frequency is off by an order of
magnitude:</p>

<p>But then if you actually start sending a signal and set it again, it
becomes correct:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-8475/images/3197871449080840080.jpg" src="projects/project-8475/images/3197871449080840080.jpg" />
<p>Well, correct apart from some twitching, and it would still change
directions randomly. Since I couldn’t find the reason for that in the
signal, I turned to the power. And yes, replacing the two alkaline AAA
batteries with a 3.7V LiPo battery solved that problem.</p>
