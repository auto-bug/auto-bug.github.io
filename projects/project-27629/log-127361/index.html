<h1>New Shipment Soon<a class="headerlink" href="#new-shipment-soon" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2018-03-23 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-27629"><span class="std std-ref">µGame</span></a>.</p>
<p>I just asked <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/245194">&#64;Makerfabs </a> for a quote on a new batch of µGames to be produced, and if everything
goes well, they will be in stock in a couple of weeks. Also, the 3.0
version of CircuitPython is coming soon, and there will be a firmware
update. The new version has greatly improved memory management, so it
should help a little. I also fixed a few small bugs, and I plan to
finally add the build-in art assets, which should also help with
memory somewhat.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I started to work on <span class="xref std std-ref">project-86818</span> , and I entered it in the Hackaday Prize. I am not yet entirely sure
where I will take this project, the only thing I’m certain of is that
I want to keep it compatible with the current µGame — so that all the
people who bought it are not left with an obsolete device. The new
version will have more memory, so hopefully you won’t need to pre-
compile your files anymore, and I want to try and make it have proper
audio, with volume control and headphone jack, a physically bigger
display, and better connectors for external stuff. It will probably be
more expensive, too, so it’s more like an alternative to µGame
coexisting with it side-by-side rather than a replacement.</p>
<p>Finally, I just started today some sketches for another handheld, a <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-100853/#project-100853"><span class="std std-ref">CircuitPython Badge</span></a> , which is supposed to be even more minimal than µGame. The goal here
is to minimize the price and power consumption, so that it could be
used as a conference badge, given out to all participants. It’s not
going to be compatible with µGame, though.</p>
