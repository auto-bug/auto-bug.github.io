<p>Published on 2017-11-11 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-27629"><span class="std std-ref">µGame</span></a>.</p>
<p>Just before going on a two week vacation, I decided to try and see
what I can do in terms of a case for this device. Why do I even need a
case? Well, there are two reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>To protect the glass (but not gorilla-glass) screen from scratches, so
that I can carry it in my pocket,</p></li>
<li><p>To protect the battery both mechanically and electrically from random
objects in that pocket.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s connected with the fact that I want to use a bigger LiPo battery
than the 40mAh button cell battery I use right now.</p>
<p>With those goals in mind, what are my options?</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Use an existing, commonly available container of roughly the right
size.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the case out of layers of laser-cut transparent acrylic.</p></li>
<li><p>3D-print it, possibly adding laser-cut transparent acrylic as screen
protection.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To see which of those options would be the best, I exported the PCB to
Inkscape and prepared a model of the device, with all buttons,
switches, sockets and the screen marked.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-27629/images/7944801510418793912.png" src="projects/project-27629/images/7944801510418793912.png" />
<p>Then I tried to fiddle with it a bit, trying to come up with the
layers for the laser-cut case. I immediately stumbled on a problem:
the power switch (and also the reset switch, but that one could only
have a hole to be pressed with a paperclip) only sticks out of the PCB
very little — about 1mm. That means that the wall of the case can’t be
thicker than that, or that it needs to add some kind of an extension
of the switch’s knob. The USB port has a similar problem, but
fortunately in this case it’s more like 2mm, so it’s not so bad.</p>
<p>There is also another problem if I decide to go for thin walls — the
front panel needs cutouts for the buttons, and those pretty much touch
the edge of the PCB, making this arrow-shaped corner of the panel,
where the only mounting screw is, very fragile and easy to break
off…</p>
<p>That’s the status for now. I will probably keep thinking about this
during my vacation, and will try something when I get back.</p>
