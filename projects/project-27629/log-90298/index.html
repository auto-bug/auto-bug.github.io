<p>Published on 2018-02-11 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-27629"><span class="std std-ref">µGame</span></a>.</p>
<p>It took less than two weeks, and all the µGames 10 are sold. I am both
a bit surprised with how fast it went, and very grateful to everyone
who bought one (a lot of them went to my friends). I don’t plan on
making any more of them for the next few weeks, at least until the
Lunar New Year ends. I am now focusing on support of the devices that
have their new owners, and on updating the firmware.</p>
<p>Speaking of support, I already got some really valuable feedback. <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/55780">&#64;Frank Buss </a> seems to have a knack for finding all the rough edges, and his
suggestions already improved the documentation and resulted in some
ideas about improving the firmware. Jell also reported some issues,
which have been added to the docs. I expect to receive even more
feedback as the devices arrive and their owners start experimenting
with them seriously.</p>
<p>I’m also going to work on making an emulator for this device — even if
it’s not going to emulate all of its limitations, it should allow
easier development and debugging. You will still need to test against
a real device to make sure that there is enough memory and that the
speed is acceptable, though — it’s not going to be a “real” emulator,
just a version of the Stage library that runs on regular Python.</p>
