<h1>Version 6<a class="headerlink" href="#version-6" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-12-13 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-27629"><span class="std std-ref">µGame</span></a>.</p>
<p>The PCBs for version 6 arrived about a week ago, but I didn’t have
time to work on it, between the day job and being sick. This evening I
finally tested it properly:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-27629/images/5886841513202019440.jpg" src="projects/project-27629/images/5886841513202019440.jpg" />
<p>The good things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>moving the audio circuit was a good move, it’s now completely out of
reach of fingers, and I think it also seems a bit louder when the LOS
is not obscured by hands,</p></li>
<li><p>using straight switch instead of angled one for reset also works well
— I can have a hole in the case (if I have a case) for pressing it
with a pin,</p></li>
<li><p>straight buttons are easier to solder,</p></li>
<li><p>adding a CS pin made the displays all work consistently,</p></li>
<li><p>moving the LDO away from the buttons also made it easier to solder.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are still some rough edges, though, that I only found out after
actually testing a physical prototype.</p>
<p>The bad things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the CS pin uses a via, and touching that via with your fingers makes
the display stop updating — I need to route that trace on front side
entirely,</p></li>
<li><p>the charging LED still shines whenever USB is connected, even if the
battery is disconnected  — it does go off when the battery is fully
charged, though,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So I scrapped the version 7 which was basically just a cleanup of
version 6 ready for ordering a larger number of them, and prepared
version 8. I moved practically all parts around, including the
microcontroller and the flash chip, but now:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the reset button is next to the direction buttons, not on the edge of
the pcb,</p></li>
<li><p>all components, except for the audio circuit, are together in the
middle of the board,</p></li>
<li><p>the signals for audio and for the display are routed on one side
without any vias,</p></li>
<li><p>there are no parts under the fingers anymore,</p></li>
<li><p>the top fire button got moved to the edge to make room for the parts,
so now the layout looks more like gameboy,</p></li>
<li><p>all the parts are better spaced and have shorter traces between them,</p></li>
<li><p>there are more mounting holes (some are under the display, but with
flat heads that could still be useful),</p></li>
<li><p>I have broken out four unused pins on the back, for possible hacking,</p></li>
<li><p>I moved the battery connector to the other side of the board, so it
now matches the layout of Nokia phone (dumb) batteries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I know I said that about the previous version, but this is really to
be the last one I’m making (at least with this microcontroller and
display) — if everything works, that is. I’m going to order this one
at Aisler again, to see how they improved (and to get a stencil).</p>
