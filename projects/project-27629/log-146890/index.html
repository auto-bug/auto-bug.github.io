<p>Published on 2018-05-28 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-27629</span>.</p>
<p>After working on research and design for the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-86818</span> for several months, and after Adafruit has started to work on their
own version of a game console for CircuitPython, I decided that the
improvements are not really worth the extra price and work, and
decided to come back and focus on regular µGame more.</p>
<p>There will be no more hardware iterations (except perhaps a small
update changing the USB port to one that is more friendly to the
fabricators), but there is still a lot that can be done in firmware
and in the libraries. In particular, I have some ideas that I want to
try to speed up the screen updates and to make more memory available
for the games.</p>
<p>The CircuitPython 3.0 is coming, Beta0 version was just released last
week, and I’ve been working a little bit to make sure that all the
libraries for µGame work with it. Right now I’m struggling with a
change in the API for AudioIO, which makes CircuitPython try to
allocate an extra 512 bytes of RAM every time you try to play a sound.
Obviously that fails randomly in any larger game, as there is simply
no room for it. But I’m sure a solution can be found — in the worst
case, I will switch to a different way of making sounds.</p>
