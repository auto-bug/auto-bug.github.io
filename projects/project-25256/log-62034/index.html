<h1>Buttons<a class="headerlink" href="#buttons" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-06-23 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-25256</span>.</p>
<p>Pretty much every GPIO pin not used for the display or audio is used
for the buttons. I decided to make it simple and just use a separate
pin for every button. The list looks like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>UP 20</p></li>
<li><p>DOWN 26</p></li>
<li><p>LEFT 16</p></li>
<li><p>RIGHT 6</p></li>
<li><p>A 23</p></li>
<li><p>B 7</p></li>
<li><p>L1 12</p></li>
<li><p>L2 5</p></li>
<li><p>R1 4</p></li>
<li><p>R2 17</p></li>
<li><p>START 22</p></li>
<li><p>SELECT 27</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, pins 13 and 18 are used for audio, and pins 8, 10, 11,
24, 25 are used by the display. I didn’t plan the pins for the keys
too much – I just connected whatever was closest to the physical
button. That means that, for example, L1 is using the same pin as the
ZeroLiPO module uses to signal shutdown… but I think I can move
that.</p>
<p>In any case, initially I planned to use <a class="reference external" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/retro-gaming-with-raspberry-pi/adding-controls-software">Adafruit’s RetroGame</a>  daemon that constantly polls the pins and then generates keypress
events. But someone on the #raspberrypi channel on Freenode suggested
that I can use Device Tree Overlays instead. I got interested and
decided to try it.</p>
<p>As with all the Linux Kernel stuff, there is practically no
documentation, you have to read the source code. Fortunately I found a
pretty nice <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.gegg.us/2017/01/setting-up-a-gpio-button-keyboard-on-a-raspberry-pi/">example for configuring a GPIO keyboard</a> . I tested it on a few of my keys, and it worked great! Awesome, that
was easier than expected! I quickly added the rest of my keys to the
overlay file, compiled it and restarted, expecting it to work. Of
course it didn’t. Checking dmesg let me see error messages suggesting
that the kernel driver can’t claim pins 7 and 20, because they are
being used by the SPI peripheral. Of course I can’t disable SPI,
because that’s how my display is connected. But I’m not using all
those pins. How can I tell the driver that?</p>
<p>After a few hours of searching the Internet, trawling through source
files, trying various things, etc. I finally realized that I’m wasting
my time. I just deleted all this overlay nonsense, installed the
Adafruit demon, configured it quickly and that’s it. Somehow the demon
doesn’t have any problems with any pins being used by something else.</p>
<p>But there is one more thing I learned, which might make me re-thing
the pin mapping and actually try to get this to work. Apparently Pi
HATs can have on them a small EEPROM memory chip, to which we can
record the overlays that this shield needs. That means that with a
little work (and fixing some bugs in the kernel, I’m sure), it would
be possible to build a shield that would require no manual
configuration: just connect it switch it on, and it just works. That
would be great, <em>if</em> it worked.</p>
