<p>Published on 2017-12-04 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-13278"><span class="std std-ref">Servo Breakout for WeMos D1 Mini</span></a>.</p>
<p>There is a relatively high demand for this board on Tindie, so when I
sold the last of the 75 hand-assembled modules, I stated looking at
fabrication options. Unfortunately, for a board with so many soldering
points (the servo socket headers), it was relatively expensive. I
didn’t realize that the work I was doing by hand is worth so much. In
any case, I asked several fabrication services for quotes, and since I
didn’t want to increase the price too much, went with the cheapest
one, which turned out to be PCBWay.</p>
<p>They were very helpful all along the way. The bill of materials CSV
file I sent them didn’t parse quite well for them (probably because I
wrote it by hand in Vim), but they had no problem with me just
including an ASCII-art table in the e-mail instead. On every step of
the process they sent me photos, asking if it looks correct. They also
tried to catch possible errors themselves: for example, my BOM didn’t
include the stacking headers that I add to every module — they saw
them in the photo and asked if they need to be added. (I send them
unsoldered, so I add them later myself). There was also one small
glitch when they initially wanted to use straight pin headers instead
of angled ones, but because they sent me the photo I could point out
the mistake, and there was no problem switching to the correct
headers.</p>
<p>I choose the cheapest shipping (again to keep the price low), but it
still arrived without problems in 2 weeks. Here’s a photo of the
package I got:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-13278/images/7901051512382432339.jpg" src="projects/project-13278/images/7901051512382432339.jpg" />
<p>The anti-static bags on the bottom contain the soldered panels (I
choose to depanelize them myself, again to save costs). The rest of
the bags are all the left-over parts, including one unsoldered PCB
panel of 5 modules.</p>
<p>A quick test shows that the modules work very well.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m very happy with them. You can buy the new modules on
Tindie here:  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/16-channel-servo-shield-for-d1-mini-version-20/">https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/16-channel-servo-shield-
