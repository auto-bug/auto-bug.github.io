<h1>Is E-ink Ready Yet?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-e-ink-ready-yet" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>

<p>Of course the obvious solution for a display for a conference badge is
e-paper or e-ink display. It has a number of advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>keeps displaying with the device off, which means that you could even
do without the battery, or — if you really want to have interactive
elements there — have the microcontroller sleep most of the time,</p></li>
<li><p>high contrast, readable from a distance,</p></li>
<li><p>low resolution and color count — which means low RAM requirements,</p></li>
<li><p>relatively new and very cool technology,</p></li>
<li><p>physically robust (at least more so than glass displays) and safe when
broken (no sharp edges),</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It also has a couple of drawbacks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>slow to update — even more so than the LCDs, partial updates help
somewhat,</p></li>
<li><p>expensive, at least until recently,</p></li>
<li><p>requires additional components for the high-voltage driving — but any
larger OLED has the same problem,</p></li>
<li><p>no ready libraries — but I would write my own libraries for the
display anyways,</p></li>
<li><p>risky, requires research,</p></li>
<li><p>no idea how easy to source it is in larger quantities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But all in all, it is certainly an interesting option to explore. So I
went to my favorite Chinese shopping website, and had a look around.
Sure enough, most of those displays cost around 4x more than I would
like the whole device to cost, but there are some interesting options.
In particular, the GDEW0154T8 display can be bought for less than $5,
even cheaper in larger quantities. But is there any documentation for
it? Yes!</p>
<p>A bit of googling, and we can find <a class="reference external" href="https://www.smart-prototyping.com/E-ink-E-paper-Display">this page</a> , with links to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.smart-prototyping.com/image/data/9_Modules/EinkDisplay/GDEW0154T8/GDEW0154T8.zip">the datasheet for the display</a>  and for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.smart-prototyping.com/image/data/9_Modules/EinkDisplay/GDEW0154T8/IL0373.pdf">the driving chip</a> .</p>
<p>Looking at the datasheet, it doesn’t look bad. Resolution 152×152,
1-bit color, 6s refresh time — sure, not too great, but for that price
what can you expect. More importantly, there is a typical application
circuit example there, and it only has 11 capacitors, 3 Schottky
diodes, a resistor, a mosfet and an inductor. There is also a
temperature sensor, but looking at the breakout boards, it seems to be
optional.</p>

<p>I could live with that. More details when the breakouts and displays
arrive.\</p>
