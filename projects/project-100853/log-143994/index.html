<p>I couldn’t sleep this night, and that means I got to redo the PCB from
the last log. I like it much better now:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/6089331523713410327.png" src="../../../_images/6089331523713410327.png" />
<p>There is a number of improvements and cool things about it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Most components (except for the display driver and accelerometer) are
not covered by the display, so they can be easily inspected and
debugged.</p></li>
<li><p>The USB socket and the switch are now on the side, which means you can
have the empty part of the badge either at the top or at the bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>I got rid of the prototyping area (nobody would have a soldering iron
at the conference anyways), and replaced it with two grove connectors
— one for I²C and one for analog in/out.</p></li>
<li><p>The accelerometer is in the center of the board, so you can easily
calculate its orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a footprint for an NRF24L01 radio module. I am not yet sure
what we will use for communication, but this module is common and
cheap, and lets us provide a similar interface to what the “radio”
module does on the micro:bit. This could be easily modified to instead
have a wifi, bluetooth, lora, nfc or anything else — the pins used
support both SPI and UART.</p></li>
<li><p>The back of the board is still completely empty, and has plenty of
room for the battery holder. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to include
mounting holes for the holder (they would be in the center, where the
accelerometer and display driver are), so it will need to be glued
with a double-sided tape.</p></li>
<li><p>The display’s LEDs are powered directly from the USB or battery,
without voltage regulation — that should save some power. As a side
effect, because USB will have higher voltage than the battery, the
display will probably be a little bit brighter when connected.</p></li>
<li><p>The switch switches between battery and USB power, so no diodes or
mosfets necessaery for backfeed protection of the USB.</p></li>
<li><p>The MCU has a double footprint — for both QFN and TQFP packages. I’m
going to use TQFP for testing, because they are easier to handle and
that’s what I have at hand, but for production QFN is cheaper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with it already. Over the weekend I will
poke at it a little bit more, verify everything, and on Monday I’m
going to order a prototype PCB.</p>
