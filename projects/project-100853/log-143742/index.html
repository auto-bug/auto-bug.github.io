<h1>Taking a Step Back<a class="headerlink" href="#taking-a-step-back" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2018-04-12 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-100853"><span class="std std-ref">CircuitPython Badge</span></a>.</p>
<p>After indulging myself with trying out different hardware and
prototypes, I realized that I really don’t have enough information to
design a good badge. You know, all those displays and chips and
sensors and buttons and batteries are cool, but at the end of the day
you have to <em>design</em> something that serves a <em>purpose</em>, and if you
don’t make that the center of your design, there is a big chance it
will suck. So let’s take a step back and think what we need.</p>
<section id="core-functionalities">
<h2>Core Functionalities<a class="headerlink" href="#core-functionalities" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Things without which a badge is not a badge. These are non-negotiable
requirements.</p>
<section id="identification">
<h3>Identification<a class="headerlink" href="#identification" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is so basic, that it’s easy to forget about it, and go designing
watches or belt buckles. First and foremost a conference badge has to
identify its wearer to all other conference participants that they
might meet. That usually means that it has to have the owner’s name
(or nickname) displayed prominently somewhere at all times in a way
that makes it visible and easy to read from a relatively large
distance.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that the badge has to be worn in a visible
place (traditionally on your neck, but clipped to your breast pocket
or bag strap would also work). It also sets the minimum size of the
badge — it can’t be the 5×5cm tiny little device that I initially
planned — that will simply not work.</p>
<p>The simplest, most fault-proof, long-lasting, convenient and obvious
way of achieving this is to simply have a white area on the badge
where you can write your name with a sharpie. It always works, even if
you run out of battery or release the blue smoke, you can fix it if
you made a mistake, and you don’t need to know the names of all
participants up front — you can even have some spare badges. It also
makes it obvious which badge is yours, in case you mix them up while
hacking on them.</p>
<p>I really have no idea what I was thinking with the e-ink display.</p>
</section>
<section id="contact">
<h3>Contact<a class="headerlink" href="#contact" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The second function of a badge like this is to provide your contact
information to anyone you choose. Whether it’s a vendor at a booth
asking to scan your badge, another participant that you have just
chatted with and want to continue it online, or a group of people that
you want to go to lunch with next day — the idea is pretty much the
same.</p>
<p>The simplest, “analog” way of solving this is of course to have your
e-mail address (or twitter handle, or whatever) written then on your
badge, in letters small enough to not be visible from afar, so that
the people wanting to copy it (or take a photo) have to come close and
possibly ask you. But there is a lot of room for technology here.</p>
<p>Bar and QR codes, NFC tags, IR beaming, BLE and other wireless
communication methods can be helpful here. Being compatible with
existing devices, such as phones, is a big plus here, of course, but
we shouldn’t require people to have a phone to use it. Ideally, there
would be several methods available, with the analog fallback in case
of a dead battery.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="extras">
<h2>Extras<a class="headerlink" href="#extras" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Those are the thing that make the electronic badge more useful than
the piece of paper that you normally get. They should be good enough
to justify the extra expense and hassle.</p>
<section id="self-expression">
<h3>Self-expression<a class="headerlink" href="#self-expression" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is a Python-based badge for Python conferences, so it’s
fundamental that you should be able to (easily) program it with
Python. That’s the whole point of using MicroPython/CircuitPython
here. But it’s not enough to just be able to run your program on it —
you should be able to show off the programs you have written!</p>
<p>That means that the badge must be able to run the program while you
are wearing it (and not just when connected to your computer), which
implies a battery. It also means that the results of running that
program should be visible and unique.</p>
<p>RGB LEDs are nice for that, because they are flashy, colorful, and
visible from far away, especially when blinking or cycling colors.
Unfortunately, a lot of LEDs can run down your battery pretty fast,
and also there is only so many ways you can make them blink — so the
uniqueness aspect suffers a bit.</p>
<p>A LED matrix provides much more freedom of expression. Even if it’s
monochromatic, you can display images, scroll text, play animations,
visualize data, etc. — the possibilities are very rich and can be very
unique.</p>
<p>A display can be even better, even though cheap displays are rather
small, so it wouldn’t be so visible from afar.</p>
<p>Sound could also be used for self-expression, but it can get very
messy when a lot of people do it all at once. There would also have to
be a fool-proof way of muting it (preferably a physical switch) for
the talks.</p>
</section>
<section id="entertainment">
<h3>Entertainment<a class="headerlink" href="#entertainment" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>It would be nice if it was possible to play games on the badge —
either provided, or — even better — written by the participants
themselves. This can be great for the boring talks or waiting in queue
for lunch, but it could be even better to have multi-player games, or
other kinds of games requiring interactions between the participants.</p>
<p>Of course, for this you need some kind of a display (or the LED
matrix), some kind of controls (buttons, accelerometer) and for the
multiplayer things — some means of communication. All this should come
with simple to use libraries and pre-packaged graphics, so that people
can make something nice fast.</p>
<p>The display for games should’t have too big of a resolution, so that
you won’t need to push a lot of pixels to update it, and it should be
fast, so that you can do animations and so on. Of course there are
games like 2048 or sudoku that will work on slow displays too.</p>
</section>
<section id="schedule">
<h3>Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#schedule" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is my initial idea for this project, but as you can see, it got
relegated to quite a low priority by now. If you are giving the
participants badges, you may as well include the talk schedules on
them. With the ability to mark which talks they want to go to. And
possibly with a real time clock and notification functions. The
ability to update the schedule when there are changes in it would be
nice too.</p>
<p>This requires some means of displaying text, preferably a monochrome
display with relatively large resolution. It doesn’t have to be fast,
but should be able to do partial updates in less than 1 second. It
doesn’t have to be bright or large — you will use it while staring at
it up close.</p>
<p>This really conflicts with the other goals, so I’m really not sure
about it anymore. I guess it explains why no other badge does it.</p>
</section>
<section id="appearance">
<h3>Appearance<a class="headerlink" href="#appearance" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We still want it to look nice and be appealing to non-technical
audience, of course, but I can see to way to make you wear it outside
of the conference, considering the size requirements and the big place
for your name on it. So no accessories, no watches, no hair ornaments,
jewelry, etc. — it’s going to be a badge and it’s going to look like a
badge.</p>
</section>
<section id="hardware-hacking">
<h3>Hardware Hacking<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-hacking" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The number of people who are going to actually connect anything to
their badges is going to be small probably — there are so many other
things you can do at a conference. But adding a breadboard-friendly
pin header somewhere should be easy, so why not do it. This is also a
way to provide extension modules with additional sensors and devices
that didn’t fit in the budget for everyone, but are interesting to
more advanced users.</p>
