<p>Published on 2016-03-23 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-10491"><span class="std std-ref">Lodestar</span></a>.</p>
<p>So this is what was born from the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-7663</span>  experiments. Back then, I assembled a 5×5×5 RGB LED cube by soldering
the NeoPixels directly together, and managed to get some very nice
lightning effects with that. But the soldering job wasn’t very good,
the device was brittle, the LEDs would flicker off at a touch, and the
walls of the cube became somewhat rounded.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-10491/images/108021458761550860.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/108021458761550860.jpg" />
<p>So I decided to do a second approach. This time I’m going to solder
the LEDs onto 6 PCBs. <a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=17614&amp;accesskey=f1f730c997b8961c9ada95dd2be1916b">I ordered them from DirtyPCBs</a>  some time ago, and I was lucky, because the proto-pack contains 12
boards – enough to make two cubes! Anyways, I only have enough
NeoPixels to make one for now, but it’s nice to know that I have a
spare. The connections on the board follow what I came up back when I
worked on <span class="xref std std-ref">project-7663</span> :</p>
<img alt="projects/project-10491/images/2992871458761711305.png" src="projects/project-10491/images/2992871458761711305.png" />
<p>I already tried to solder one board by hand, and I must say it’s hard.
There is so little room between the LEDs, and it’s so hard to keep
them straight… The result is not very pretty:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-10491/images/2670031458762084874.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/2670031458762084874.jpg" />
<p>It would probably look fine if I encased it in a laser-cut box made of
matte acrylic, but still, I think I can do better. So I paused with
the other boards for now, and ordered a solder paste. I will try to
use that together with a hot plate to get better results.</p>
<p>That’s it about the outside.</p>
<p>On the inside, I plan to install an ESP8266 module, together with 3D
compass and GPS modules. And a small LiPo battery, of course. The hope
is that this will let me figure out where in the world the cube is and
how it is oriented, and then animate the lights to point to the next
way-point. We will see how that works out.</p>
