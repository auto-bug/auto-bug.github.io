<p>I’m taking this slow, figuring things as I go. Since my other projects
went bad recently (I literally fried a PCB in one, and the other is
drowned in instant glue), I decided to do anything with this one. So I
went and screwed the servo horns to the legs properly:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-10665/images/8920321460658634429.jpg" src="projects/project-10665/images/8920321460658634429.jpg" />
<p>As a side note, I really love this drill handle I got at some RC model
fair. It’s perfect for making small, precise holes in delicate things,
where a dremel wouldn’t work so well. So some drilling and some M1.5x3
screws, and the horns are all properly attached.</p>
<p>Next, I figured a way to attach the servos. I have some of those
foamed plastic sheets, and they are perfect for prototyping – soft
enough to cut with a knife, but sturdy enough to build something out
of them. I initially wanted to make the whole robot from it (like I
did with <span class="xref std std-ref">project-8521</span> ), but I wasn’t sure what plastic it is exactly and if I can safely
put that into the laser cutter, without damaging the lens with the
fumes. Anyways, I cut some squares of that, cut an additional hole for
the cable in them, and glued them to the body with instant glue. Then
I simply used the screws that came with the servos to attach them to
that. Looks better than I anticipated:</p>

<p>One mistake I made, and I’m going to correct that in the “clean”
version – I put the servos too high. But that should be fine for
testing.</p>
