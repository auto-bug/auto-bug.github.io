<h1>Why a New Design?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-a-new-design" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2022-05-09 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-185291"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew LCD</span></a>.</p>
<p>So far the most successful among the PewPew family of devices has been
the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-159733/#project-159733"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew Standalone</span></a> – I ran many workshops with it, I sold it on Tindie, I made several
badges for conferences out of it, and now <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/268569">&#64;Makerfabs </a> is selling it for general population to use. Despite being a bit
clunky, it’s simple and cheap and gets the job done very well. I have
later experimented with other designs, adding various display screens,
stronger microcontrollers, a variety of buttons and touh pads,
different LEDs and recently even WiFi, but the resulting designs were
inevitably more complex and more expensive. Now I feel like I can put
together what I have learned through all this experimentation, and
design a device that is even better for running workshops, less
complex, and cheaper than the Standalone.</p>
<p>The problematic component is the LED matrix. Yes, it’s cheap, but
that’s pretty much its only advantage. The original FeatherWing
version used a bi-color matrix, with four possible colors. In the
Standalone I replaced it with a much easier to source and to drive,
and also cheaper, monochrome matrix, that is driven in the background
by a special software library compiled into CircuitPython. There are
no longer any colors, just shades of light, and to save pins, the same
library also scans for the button presses. This leads to some visual
artifacts and of course displaying text is not easy.</p>
<p>I have tried replacing the LED matrix with individual LEDs – either
bi-color or monochrome, but while this makes the device considerably
slimmer and lighter, it increases the assembly cost – with all those
discrete LEDs having to be soldered.</p>
<p>Adding a color TFT screen required more memory and more processing
power, and while the resulting device is very nice on its own, and
lets you make much more advanced and nicer games, it is also more
expensive and complex – not suitable for quick workshops anymore.</p>
<p>Finally, I was pretty happy with a monochrome OLED screen. The
additional code required forced me to shrink the filesystem on the
device a little bit, from 64kB to 48kB, but you can still fit all the
games that have been written for the device so far on it all at once,
so I don’t consider it a big drawback. The screen is the wrong shape,
landscape rather than square, so a lot of it is wasted, which is not
great, but acceptable. The additional components required by the
display, and the large number of connections of the display itself
contributed to both the complexity and price, though. I tried to
offset it by shedding components such as buttons, battery holder, USB
socket and expansion socket with pads and cutouts in the PCB itself –
and I am happy with the results – but I feel like I can do better
still, with a different display.</p>
