<h1>EuroPython 2022<a class="headerlink" href="#europython-2022" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2022-07-19 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-185291"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew LCD</span></a>.</p>
<p>Last week I was in Dublin at the EuroPython conference, and we did a
number of PewPew-related activities. There was a whole-day workshop
with the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-159733/#project-159733"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew Standalone</span></a> devices we had left over from 2019 — I think it mostly went well,
except for some Mac users who only had USB-C ports on their computers,
and no adapters. I think I will need to get some adapters or C-to-
micro cables for the future workshops.</p>
<p>A few more people played with the PewPews through the conference at
the “maker fest” tables, and I also showed off the new PewPew LCD,
which seems to be very well received. Then I gave a talk about making
games with CircuitPython in general, and about all those handheld game
consoles running CircuitPython — the talk wasn’t very popular, but I
hope that I got the people who came to see it interested in this.</p>
<p>Finally, after the conference, during the sprints, we worked on some
more PewPew games, and I also showed a few people how to contribute to
CircuitPython itself. It was great fun.</p>
<p>At the end of the conference, the organizers decided to give out all
the left-over PewPew devices, so we will have a couple hundred more
users afterwards! Huge thanks to the EuroPython organizers for making
it all possible!</p>
