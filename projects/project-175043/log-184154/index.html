<h1>Down the Rabbit Hole<a class="headerlink" href="#down-the-rabbit-hole" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2020-09-27 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-175043</span>.</p>
<p>I usually get an urge to buy or make a new keyboard around this time
of the year, but it usually ends in disappointment, as I have very
specific requirements for my keyboards: they have to be low-profile,
no wobbly keys, ins in del in proper places, preferably tenkeyless,
etc. Making them is easier than finding ready ones, but my last
attempt with <span class="xref std std-ref">project-167912</span> didn’t work that well due to too much experimenting on my side, and I
went back to my current best  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.prohavit.com/products/hv-kb390l-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard/">hv-kb390l</a> .</p>
<p>But this year I decided to experiment with sub-40% keyboards, just
because they are cheaper to make than full-size ones, due to small
number of keys, and after making <span class="xref std std-ref">project-174095</span> I was surprised how comfortable they are! That was a bit too small,
though, so I upgraded it to <span class="xref std std-ref">project-174917</span> and that’s what I’m using right now. For the first time in my life I’m
properly typing with all fingers on on the home row, and I enjoy it a
lot! Thinking about how it could be improved further, I decided that
splitting it, to put the hands further apart is a good idea, however,
I want to keep it in one piece.</p>
<p>I did experiment a bit with a minimal keyboard back when I assembled
the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-167897</span> , but the default layout that this keyboard had didn’t resonate with
me, and also having the two halves separate doesn’t work so well for
me, as they tend to wander all over my desk, and then I have problems
finding the right hand one after moving my mouse.</p>
<p>So the next steps on my keyboard journey are in two directions: first,
I decided to scavenge the failed <span class="xref std std-ref">project-167912</span> for switches and re-build it as an ergonomic <span class="xref std std-ref">project-174982</span> — that project is already ongoing, and I’m waiting for the PCB for it.
I’m not sure it will be usable, as I’m not a big fan of those
switches, and being that flat doesn’t necessarily work for such a
large keyboard. We will see. So, at the same time, I’m also designing
a flat <a class="reference external" href="http://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a> , which is basically what I’m using right now with the Dorsch 48k, but
ergonomic and with more keys for the thumbs.</p>
<p>This project will probably take a little bit longer, since I don’t
have the switches for it, and I don’t want to make another order just
yet. I might scavenge the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-174095</span> for it in the end, but I would rather not. So I will design the PCB
and let it sit for a bit — this way there is also a chance that the
design can be improved with what I learned from the Turbot.</p>
<p>A quick take on the PCB looks like this:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175043/images/2208121601217167883.png" src="projects/project-175043/images/2208121601217167883.png" />
<p>I posted it on Mastodon, but then the original author of Atreus chimed
in, and told me they improved the design by adding two more thumb
keys. So I followed their advice and updated the design:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175043/images/5991111601217247381.png" src="projects/project-175043/images/5991111601217247381.png" />
<img alt="projects/project-175043/images/8715141601217256449.png" src="projects/project-175043/images/8715141601217256449.png" />
<p>I’m mostly happy with it (found a couple of mistakes since making this
render, but it’s mostly the same), and I think I will go with it in
the end, but I will give it some more time to sit there and ripen.</p>
<p>And yes, it does look a little bit like a bat, so maybe it fits the
Halloween theme.</p>
