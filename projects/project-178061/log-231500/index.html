<p>The d-pad and buttons for the case were a long-time problem for me. Laser-cutting them gives pretty nice effects, but there is no easy way of making them stay in place. I tried gluing them to the buttons, sticking the buttons into a hole in them, gluing additional parts to the bottom to hook against the case, and finally I settled on a sticky tape applied from the back. But it never was quite right.</p>
<p>Recently, I finally tried 3D-printing them. It’s a problem for me, because I
don’t really have an easy access to a 3D-printer. I don’t own one, and the ones
in the hackerspaces and fablabs around are always either broken or there is a
long queue of people wanting to use them. But the PCB factories started to
offer also 3D printing services, so I decided to try one of those. An
additional advantage is that a small and precise part like those button caps is
best printed with resin, and that’s even harder to come by in local fablabs.</p>
<p>So I started my trusty OpenSCAD, and quickly made a 3D model of the d-pad and buttons, and then exported it as an STL file. I went through several iterations, and after I added rounded edges with Minkowsky sum, I had to actually move to my work laptop to generate the STL, because it was running out of memory. Well, I only need to render it once, so that’s fine. In the end I came up with this:</p>

<p>I tried several different resins, including transparent, but I think the best
result is with the cheap black resin that JLC offers.</p>

<p>I’m really happy with how this came out. The buttons have a slight texture to
them, and are pleasant to touch. They also sit in there very well, and after I
got the height of the insides right, they work very well mechanically. The
buttons under them are clicky, but with very low force, so the end result is
very pleasant.</p>
<p>I also made an empty PCB with sole nice pattern and silkscreen to serve as the
back cover. It works well with the thin pouch LiPo batteries, and with the
large-headed machine screws.</p>
