<h1>S3<a class="headerlink" href="#s3" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2024-06-07 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-178061"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew S2</span></a>.</p>
<p>New microcontrollers keep coming out, and each one looks like an
interesting choice for a game console. I have been working a little
bit on the Xiao S3, so I decided to try and make a PCB for it with the
same display and buttons. I also used it as a test for the solderable
nuts that I wrote about in <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-186921/#project-186921"><span class="std std-ref">µGame 22</span></a> .</p>
<img alt="projects/project-178061/images/1846391717777136617.png" src="projects/project-178061/images/1846391717777136617.png" />
<p>I started with the latest PCB for uGame 22, and removed the RP2)40
chip and all related components. That left me with the power and audio
citcuits, which I moved to the other side of the board. I then placed
the Xiao footprint in a cutout, so that it can be flush with the PCB
from the bottom. The rendering doesn’t show it, because it assumes the
module will go on the bottom of the PCB, when in fact it’s supposed to
go on the top, partially fitting in that cutout.</p>
<p>I also had to change how the buttons are handled, because Xiao only
has 11 usable GPIO pins. So I added a shift register, knowing that
CircuitPython already has a keypad library that handles it in the
background. Unfortunately that also meant adding explicit pull-up
resistors for each button.</p>
<p>Finally, I added the solderable nut footprints. I already got some
samples, so I knew what to expect from them. The render shows hex
nuts, but the ones I ended up using are actually round. But they are
still 3mm high, the same as the middle layer of acrylic was supposed
to be. I placed them in the same spots as the screw holes were, so I
can reuse the acrylic parts I already have.</p>

<p>When the PCBs arrived, I assembled one, skipping the power circuit – I
didn’t feel like looking for the parts in the drawers, and I already
know that circuit works fine. I had to compile my own version of the
firmware, because the support for that board in CircuitPython is still
not merged, due to Seeed Studio not providing a VID/PID to use. I also
had to add the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-80626/#project-80626"><span class="std std-ref">Stage, a Tile and Sprite Engine</span></a> to the firmware, to have all my games working – it’s not usually
enabled for boards that don’t have a built-in display.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m very happy about how this microcontroller performs and
about how the solderable nuts came out mechanically. I’m now thinking
about repeating my experiment with the parallel display, but with the
ESP32-S3 this time. Who knows, maybe it was something about the RP2040
implementation that made things so slow? If the parallel display works
well, I might use a WROOM module for the next version of this console.</p>
