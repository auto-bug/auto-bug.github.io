<h1>More Quality Control<a class="headerlink" href="#more-quality-control" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-09-07 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-21578</span>.</p>
<p>I decided to assemble one of the “production” boards I made — that is,
solder the pin headers and the matrix and plug it into a feather. Sure
enough, there are problems. The left button doesn’t work, and one of
the columns doesn’t have the red color.</p>
<p>So I started debugging.</p>
<p>The button problem turned out to be due to a broken trace on the board
— they claim they do continuity testing at Seeed, but apparently this
one somehow slipped through. Adding a wire solved that.</p>
<p>The column must be a short somewhere, because adding wires doesn’t
help. I suspect it’s a short with a via under one of the buttons. I
will try to remove the buttons tomorrow, and see.</p>
<p>But that made me realize that I really have to test the assembled
boards somehow before I send them. The hot air soldering is very fast
and convenient, but it’s not as reliable as doing it with a soldering
iron, and sometimes I have to touch it up a bit afterwards.</p>
<p>There isn’t really much I can do with the matrices without soldering
them (and I can’t solder them before the headers are soldered, and I
can’t solder the headers because that would make the whole thing hard
to ship), but I have already tested them separately, and there is very
little chance of a problem with those connections. But I can at least
test that the chip is properly powered, that the I²C communication
works, and that all the buttons work. So I made a small testing jig
for this:</p>

<p>Out of 8 boards that I have soldered so far, one had a broken trace,
two had a cold joint that had to be touched up with a hand soldering
iron, and one had a short between two of the buttons (the new buttons
have a bit wider legs and barely fit in their space). Except for the
first one, all of them were easily fixed.</p>
<p>I’m still thinking about some way of possibly testing the matrix
connections — maybe I will build something with pogo pins.</p>
