<h1>Struggling with BOM<a class="headerlink" href="#struggling-with-bom" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-10-03 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-21578"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew FeatherWing</span></a>.</p>
<p>The PewPew Lite was simple enough to solder by hand. The self-
contained PewPew is not going to be so easy. Of course, I can solder a
prototype or two — I even explicitly shied away from QFN parts — but
just thinking about making a 20 pieces for a workshop makes me
shudder. So I need a PCB assembly service.</p>
<p>I have been looking at the different services, and what they need as
the input, and not very surprisingly, the main input they need is the
bill of materials, also known ass the parts list. Unfortunately, it’s
not enough to just say “a 10kΩ resistor” — you have to specify the
size, tolerance, and most importantly, the product number. Actually,
forget everything else, they just want the product number, and if the
part is exotic, a link for where to buy it.</p>
<p>So I’ve spent the last couple of evenings trying to use the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-21525</span>  service, and it has been a bumpy ride. I started with the pick-and-
place file that Fritzing generated for me — it’s a CSV file that lists
all the parts, together with their exact positions on the board. So I
just removed the irrelevant position information, and got a list of
parts in a format that could be imported into FindChips. Then
FindChips started sugeesting parts. Oh boy.</p>
<p>It couldn’t find any tact switches at all. Apparently the best
alternative to a USB micro socket is a HDMI socket. There is only one
power switch with the pinout I need, and it’s a super-expensive ALPS.
0402 20kΩ resistors simply don’t exist. Forget about any LED matrices
at all, not to mention bi-color ones. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>With much struggling and some cheating, I finally put together a BOM
list that only has 3 parts missing. I have simply added the URLs for
those in the comments. The list is at  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.findchips.com/org/10-open-hardware/list/48895-pewpew-41-bomcsv">https://www.findchips.com/org/10-open-
hardware/list/48895-pewpew-41-bomcsv</a></p>
<p>The good news is that the total cost of all parts seems to be around
$15 at quantity 1. That means that together with the PCBs and the
assembly service, there is a chance that the whole thing won’t be more
expensive than a Feather board.</p>
