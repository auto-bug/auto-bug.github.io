<h1>ESP8266 GPIOs Suck<a class="headerlink" href="#esp8266-gpios-suck" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-05-16 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-21578"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew FeatherWing</span></a>.</p>
<p>That’s a fact.</p>
<p>But let me start at the beginning. When I realized that the
IS31FL3733’s open/short LED detecting feature can’t be used for
reading the state of the buttons for this shield, I immediately
designed a second prototype with the buttons connected (as a button
matrix) to the GPIO pins of whatever feather board is plugged into it.
But since I needed 5 pins for that, I had to plan carefully.</p>
<p>For the row pins I choose gpio12, gpio13 and gpio15, because I wanted
to have them pulled low – and that pretty much excludes gpio0 and
gpio2, because if I pull those low, the board won’t boot. I also
avoided gpio16, because that’s connected to a LED on the Feather
HUZZAH. That left gpio14 and one more pin for the columns. The choice
was hard, but I finally semi-randomly decided to use gpio16 after all
– mostly because I didn’t want the board to fail to boot when the
user is holding a key. Yeah, I know,  a bad decision – I also forgot
about ghosting effect and generally that prototype is not going to
fly. But whatever.</p>
<p>Then I did some quick research around available keyboard handling
chips, and designed another prototype that uses a TM1650 chip, which I
ordered from China. (I will probably make yet another prototype that
uses a simple atmega both for handling the keys and for making sounds,
but more about that later.)</p>
<p>Fast forward two weeks and I found in my mailbox the PCB for the
second prototype, courtesy of OSHPark. Two days later the first
prototype PCB arrived. And the chips? They have just left China,
because the seller apparently couldn’t remember when they put them. So
here I am now, traveling to <a class="reference external" href="http://PyCon.us">PyCon.us</a>  tomorrow, wanting to show something working, with the two prototypes.
I decided to give that direct-gpio approach a try.</p>
<p>So I tried with different approaches. Pull-downs on the rows and
columns switched from high-z to high – that doesn’t seem to work, the
diode on the GPIO16 seems to be interfering. OK, then let’s remove the
pull downs and try internal pull-ups on the rows and switching from
high-z to low on the columns – nope, gpioi15 is pulled low
internally, and that’s stronger than the internal pull-up. Then maybe
reverse it, internal pull-ups on the columns and swithing between
high-z and low on the rows? Nope, pull-down on the gpio15 again, and
gpio16 doesn’t have an internal pull-up. Argh. I even tried some mixed
modes, low for gpio12 and 13, and high for gpio15, but I couldn’t get
it working.</p>
<p>In the end, I just ported my libraries to CircuitPython (which I
wanted to do anyways eventually) and used the shield with the Feather
M0 Basic board, which has none of that nonsense and simply just works,
albeit a bit slow.</p>
