<p>Published on 2017-05-31 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-21578"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew FeatherWing</span></a>.</p>
<p>I got the blinking (actually breathing) support added to the
IS31FL3733 library during the <a class="reference external" href="http://PyCon.US">PyCon.US</a>  sprints, so now you can have a nice hardware blinking cursor. Back
from the conference, and I started working on the next prototype.</p>
<p>Since I want it to have sound (simple 8-bit “pew pew” sounds, as the
name implies), I looked around a bit for some kind of dedicated sound-
generating chips. Turns out they are all pretty old, coming from old
game consoles and computers, and not actually that easy to program. So
I decided to put an 8-bit microcontroller on the board for generating
the sounds. And of course, once I have the microcontroller there, I
can drop the keyboard chip, as that microcontroller can also handle
the keys.</p>
<p>So here’s my list of requirements for that chip:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>at least 6 GPIO pins with internal pull-ups for the buttons,</p></li>
<li><p>hardware I²C slave peripheral,</p></li>
<li><p>at least 8-bit timer for sound generation with a decent speed,</p></li>
<li><p>internal oscillator,</p></li>
<li><p>small enough to fit on this board,</p></li>
<li><p>easy to program,</p></li>
<li><p>already in my drawer,</p></li>
<li><p>cheap.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum number of GPIOs is thus 10 (6 for keys, 2 for I²C, 2 for
the speaker), so that rules out the ATtiny85 and friends. Looking
through what I had on hand, I finally narrowed down my choices to two
chips: STM8S003f2 and ATmega8. The first one is very cheap, the second
one I already know quite well. I decided to start with the STM8,
because it’s always a nice bonus to learn something along the way.</p>
<p>So I re-created my dev environment and flashed the blinking LED sketch
on a STM8 development board. So far so good. Then, just for kicks, I
tried the UART example for it, but it didn’t work correctly – the
speed was all wrong. Oh well, it’s not like I’m going to need that. I
even found a nice example of an I²C slave for this chip online.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I need to make sure it actually fits on the board
with all the required components. But to determine the required
components, I need to actually use a bare chip, not this dev board. So
I found a universal breakout board, and soldered one of the chips on
it. Then I tried the blink example on it. Hmm, strange, it programmed
fine, but the pin only goes up and down a fraction of a volt –
something is fishy. I checked all my connections multiple times, tried
the same code on the dev board, used shorter wires for the required
capacitor, etc. – but nothing. It almost looks like that time when I
forgot to switch a pin to output on an AVR and was just toggling a
pull-up. Several hours and a couple of datasheets and application
notes later I decided to throw the towel. I used up all my motivation
for the day.</p>

<p>Next day I started work on the ATmega. I already had a bare ATmega8
chip nicely soldered to a PCB – one of <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-19603/#project-19603"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini Tote</span></a>  old prototypes, so I used that. Just added a piezo on PB1 and an ISP
header for easier programming. I also used the I²C slave code that I
had from that robot – it’s nice for timing-critical stuff like sound,
because it doesn’t use interrupts. A few lines of C added and I can
read the pins from the D port through I²C – the key handling is done.
(Perhaps I will add some de-bouncing there later on). Yay.</p>
<p>Encouraged with this small success, I proceeded to playing with sound.
The plan is to be able to send a bunch of parameters, similar to what
you can play with at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bfxr.net/">http://www.bfxr.net/</a> , and then have the chip play that, possible mixing multiple channels
if the sounds overlap. But I started with a simple PCM sound playback,
basing the code on <a class="reference external" href="http://avrpcm.blogspot.ch/2010/11/playing-8-bit-pcm-using-any-avr.html">http://avrpcm.blogspot.ch/2010/11/playing-8-bit-pcm-using-any-avr.html</a> . That worked pretty well, especially after a few simplifications and
some tuning. And it started to sound really good once I replaced the
piezo with a tiny speaker I got for that.</p>
<p>In fact, it worked so well, that for I moment I considered just having
a set of few fixed sounds, hard-coded as PCM data in the chip’s flash,
and triggered with I²C. But after a few calculations and experiments
with lower baud rates I realized that I would need to use a larger
ATmega328 for this, and decided to leave it as an emergency plan.</p>
<p>I started to play with generating the sound data myself. I got the
square wave, the saw wave, the triangle wave, and even some noise (my
bit-shifting and xor-ing some values). I got a frequency slide, and a
slide on top of that – which gives the nice laser sound. I even got a
nice clear coin sound. Good.</p>
<p>So the next step is to define a struct that will hold a single sound
effect, with all its parameters and variables, and then write some
code that generates samples from that. Then some simple code to send
those effect over I²C and add them to a list, and some mixing code,
and I should be good.</p>
