<h1>Making it Cheaper Again<a class="headerlink" href="#making-it-cheaper-again" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2018-07-14 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-21578"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew FeatherWing</span></a>.</p>
<p>The PewPew Lite FeatherWing is one of my favorite designs, and I think
it’s really great for learning programming games — actually better
than the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-27629/#project-27629"><span class="std std-ref">µGame</span></a> , because it’s so much simpler. The shield itself is pretty cheap,
too. Unfortunately, you still need to have a Feather M0 (or, even
better, M0 Express) to use it, and that’s actually twice as expensive
as the shield itself. Add the LiPo battery to the mix, and you could
instead buy an ODROID GO or something similar. This is problematic
especially if you want to organize a workshop — you either make a
workshop for the rich, or find a sponsor.</p>
<p>I have already tried to lower the price of the whole thing by putting
the microcontroller directly on the device — basically copying the
Trinket M0 schematic for that — but the resulting device was pretty
complex to make, and I was never quite happy with it. Plus, you still
needed the LiPo battery and its charging circuit and all that.</p>
<p>Today I sat down and redesigned the latest version of PewPew
completely, using the knowledge I gained from µGame and from the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-100853/#project-100853"><span class="std std-ref">CircuitPython Badge</span></a> to simplify it as much as possible, while still keeping its basic
functionality. That’s how I came up with PewPew 6.0:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/9513911531579693448.png" src="../../../_images/9513911531579693448.png" />
<p>It’s exactly the size of two AA batteries, because that’s what it is
going to be using for power. It uses the good old HT16K33 chip, just
like the PewPew Lite, which simplifies things a lot. However, the
buttons are handled directly by the microcontroller now, because to
have them handled by the HT16K33, I would need six extra resistors,
and I tried to minimize the parts count. To get rid of Shottky diodes
or transistors for isolating the USB VBUS, I simply used the power
switch to switch between the battery power and the USB power. I might
even skip the voltage regulator and make it always run on battery
power. Apart from that, there are the six buttons, the bi-color
matrix, the SAMD21 microcontroller itself, two pull-up resistors for
the I2C bus and two filter capacitors — that’s it. Everything is
routed on the top layer of the PCB (the bottom is one big ground
plane), and all parts (except for the battery holder) are mounted on
top, to simplify assembly. I’m using the QFN version of SAMD21,
because it’s slightly cheaper.</p>
<p>I considered using other chips than the HT16K33 for driving the
matrix, in particular, simple shift registers to do all the work in
the microcontroller, but in the end the HT16K33 is cheap enough and
does all the work for me. In the future, I might consider switching to
charlieplexed SMD bi-color LEDs and driving them from the MCU pins
directly — that would probably shave a few dollars from the BOM at the
cost of more work with assembling it.</p>
