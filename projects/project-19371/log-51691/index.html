<h1>Button Layout<a class="headerlink" href="#button-layout" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-01-10 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-19371"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini X-Pad Shield</span></a>.</p>
<p>need an easy way to add user input capabilities to my D1 Mini boards.
A joystick and some buttons would be probably the most versatile
approach – I could also use an encoder, like I did for <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-10533/#project-10533"><span class="std std-ref">Nano TTY</span></a> , however, that works well for menus, but not so good for games, and I
want to try making some games too in the future. So I need something
roughly like a game pad. A 4-way joystick, at least two buttons
(accept and back), possibly a third button for start/settings, and
possibly the fire button on the joystick. That’s eight buttons
together. Since the ESP8266 doesn’t have a lot of GPIO pins, I will
probably use a port expander – this way I can just connect it to the
I²C bus.</p>
<p>Next, I need to choose the layout for this shield. Using a standard D1
Mini shield shape doesn’t seem like a good idea, because I want to be
able to stack this with the display and led matrix shields. I could
probably use the “double” shield for this, but it would be better if
the buttons and joystick were accessible even if it’s not the top
shield.</p>
<p>I considered several options:</p>

<p>I even considered more exotic solutions, like putting all the buttons
on the sides of the board, so that they are accessible – but that’s
hard to do with the joystick, and makes it too easy to press the reset
button accidentally.</p>
<p>I finally decided to use the last design on that image above. Yes,
it’s going to be problematic with the double shield – but that can be
worked around by making one of the stacks higher.</p>

<p>I couldn’t sleep last night, so I got up and designed the PCB for this
in Fritzing. I’m going to use the good old PCF874 port expander, even
though it’s a bit dated and weird to use – but at least it’s easy to
get. Routing everything properly on such a small board was a bit
tricky, but finally I even managed to add the footprints for  the I²C
pullup resistors and the address selection jumpers. I’m pretty happy
with how it came out:One trick I had to do – I put the joystick up-
side-down. It won’t affect anything, but it makes it easier to route
the ground pin for it. Now just waiting for the PCB.</p>
