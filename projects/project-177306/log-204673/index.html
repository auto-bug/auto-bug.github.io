<p>It only took me one year to finish the version from the previous log.
Of course I assembled it as soon as the PCBs arrived, but I couldn’t
get it to work, and I blamed bad soldering on the LEDs, which
unfortunately couldn’t be easily corrected, as they have SMD
footprints, and for practical reason of being arranged in a tight
display, there is nothing sticking out.</p>
<p>After several attempts at getting it to work using my mini-hot plate,
I mostly gave up on this.</p>

<p>A few days ago I went and tried to assemble a second PCB, this time
using a more common LED footprint, that could be soldered by hand and
easily reworked. And of course it didn’t work either. So I desoldered
all but one LEDs, and started investigating, and turns out this whole
time I had the rows and columns switched. Duh.</p>
<p>So I went back to the original unit, switched the rows and columns,
and what do you know, it worked, with only a few “bad pixels” due to
soldering. But those were easy enough to fix using the hot plate, so
now I have a fully working unit. I might also finish the second one
with regular LEDs, but soldering them by hand is a bit of a chore, so
we will see.</p>
