<p>Published on 2022-03-03 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-184163"><span class="std std-ref">Vegemite Sandwich Keyboard</span></a>.</p>
<p>For starters, I decided to do something I already have well rehearsed:
a wired keyboard. There is already support for the TinyS3 in
CircuitPython, so I thought it would be easy. Just use my ukeeb
library, with the small modification for UART communication between
the halves, and I’m done. Well, not quite.</p>

<p>I got the first half to work pretty quickly — the only snag was that I
didn’t rotate the diodes when I moved them to the other side of the
PCB, so now they were all in the wrong direction — but that is easily
fixed in software. Then I moved on to get the other half to work, and
that’s where I wasted several hours of debugging time before giving up
for a week. Long story short, the UART communication was broken on the
ESP32-S3 with that version of CircuitPython, and I basically received
random bytes. I gave the project a pause, and today, I flashed version
7.2.0, which seems to have this issue solved (I just had to add
clearing the input buffer).</p>
<p>So I have a working keyboard now. One more modification I had to do is
adding a sleep in the main loop, to limit the polling speed — without
that the chip was getting noticeably warm.</p>
<p>Now, about wireless. While there is some basic BLE support in
CircuitPython for this chip right now, the services are not
implemented yet. And I need services for the HID. However, I decided
to be lazy and just take my time and wait for this to be implemented
by people who know what they are doing (hopefully), instead of rushing
head-first myself. So there is going to be another pause here.</p>
