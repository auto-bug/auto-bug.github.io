<p>Published on 2019-09-10 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-165032"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew M4</span></a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I either need to find a way to have a thicker
front plate on the case, or a better way to attach the thin front
plate, that won’t make it break at the screw holes. Last time I
experimented a bit with gluing the front plate, but that doesn’t look
good. I could try another approach: replace the acrylic plate with a
transparent sticker. But before I go there, there are also several
ways I can use a thicker plate.</p>
<p>I already have several different kinds of button switches on order —
ones that are more clicky that the current ones, but also have their
business end sticking higher, while having their base still fit in the
2.5mm space I have under the front plate. This is actually the biggest
problem, as most tact switches out there have their base 3.5mm high.
But even if those new switches work fine, there are still some
problems with this approach: the surface area of the place where you
press your finger is not very large, and those special switches will
probably be difficult to source — that will hurt the reproducibility
of the project.</p>
<p>Another approach is to use standard tact switches, but have button
caps on top of them, that will make them both higher and wider. They
could also cover the hole that would need to be cut in the top plate
for their 3.5mm high bases. So I also have two kinds of such caps on
order, and we will see how well those work.</p>
<p>The last possibility is the most interesting one: those button caps
are nothing more than pieces of plastic with a hole in them for
sticking on top of those switches. The hole is slightly conical, and
the plastic a bit springy, so once you push them in there, they stay.
What if we laser-cut out button caps from the same material as the
case? We have a large hole for the display, we could put some
additional shapes in there. And we could make them in the shapes we
actually need — a cross for the d-pad, and some rounded rectangles for
the fire buttons. The only problem is that they would have this hole
where the switch goes, but that might actually not be that bad (adding
extra texture for grip), and if it is, I could put some rubberized
stickers on top, maybe? Also, the laser-cut holes are naturally a
little bit conical (because of the laser’s colimation).</p>
<p>Since I don’t have an easy access to a laser-cutter, I decided to make
a quick test by manually drilling a hole of the right size in a piece
of acrylic, and sticking it on a tact switch. The closest size of the
drill I have is 4mm, which turned out to be ever so slightly too
small, so I used a reamer tool to make the hole a bit larger (and
conical).</p>

<p>The first observation: since acrylic is not as malleable and elastic
as ABS, the switch didn’t stick in the hole. I could probably improve
it by having a small cut in there, to make the hole more springy. But
instead I just put a drop of acrylic glue on the top of the hole, and
it sticks. There is enough wiggle room to make it work properly, and I
might add a bead in the center of the d-pad cross to make it work like
a real d-pad.</p>
<p>The hole on top doesn’t feel unpleasant to touch, and I could probably
add some more holes around it for a more consistent texture. I think
this is an interesting direction, and I might give it a try.</p>
