<h1>The Melon of Doom… Needs Work<a class="headerlink" href="#the-melon-of-doom-needs-work" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2019-09-23 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-165032"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew M4</span></a>.</p>
<p>I assembled one of the version 6 prototypes, and so far I think that
the direction is good, but requires more work and experimenting. More
details after the obligatory photo.</p>

<p>As you can see, I went here with the short black tact switches and
caps without a cut, that are glued on top of them.</p>
<p>———- more ———-The good:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The holes don’t seem to be uncomfortable and actually add a kind of
unique look.</p></li>
<li><p>Large surface of the caps make the buttons much easier to press.</p></li>
<li><p>It works well even without the bead in the center.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The regular tact switches are too high. The caps stick out of the
case too much.</p></li>
<li><p>Glue is not the best tactic — it can’t be disassembled and we risk
getting some inside the switches.</p></li>
<li><p>The holes are a little too tight a fit.</p></li>
<li><p>The screws are fine. They only go about half-way into the 2mm top
plate, but that is enough for a good grip.</p></li>
<li><p>The piezo speaker fits perfectly.</p></li>
<li><p>The black PCB really looks good with the acrylic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ugly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The fire buttons rotate. They have too much leeway, and since they
are not connected, there is nothing that would stabilize them.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the holes are too tight, the d-pad doesn’t sit perfectly
centered on the switches.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So what are the next steps?</p>
<p>I will assemble another prototype, this time using the taller 6x6x6mm
switches, and the caps with a cut across the hole, for springiness.
Those should friction-fit on the tact switches, without glue.</p>
<p>I will try to get another set of caps laser-cut locally (and possibly
another front plate as well) to experiment with different shapes, and
different holes for different switches. In particular, I want to try
the low-profile 6x6x5.5mm ones from the previous log. Maybe also a
connected version of the fire buttons, and a bigger and rounded
version of the caps (if they are round, nobody cares if they rotate).
Maybe also a version of caps for the metal tact switches — but then I
would ultimately also need a new version of the PCB, as they have a
smaller footprint, which I can deal with for testing, but not for a
finished version.</p>
<p>I will also carry the prototype a bit in my pockets, to see what
breaks this time. I can see a couple of potentially fragile places, I
will probably need to move some of the screws around.</p>
