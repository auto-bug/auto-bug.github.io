<h1>A Little Bigger Please?<a class="headerlink" href="#a-little-bigger-please" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2019-07-18 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-165032"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew M4</span></a>.</p>
<p>I have just spent a week at the Europython conference, with all
participants being given PewPews to play with. We also ran two days of
workshops for programming them, and I got to help a lot of people
trying to program them in between the talks. So I have some thoughts.</p>
<p>First of all, the serial console is a weak point. People don’t know
about it, don’t know how to access it, and as a result don’t get to
see the exception messages. So then they just try to change things
randomly or stare at their code looking for errors. We can’t count on
serial support being built-in into the editor, as not everyone can
install Mu or a plugin for their editor, and sometimes they simply are
not in the dialup group and don’t have the admin rights to add
themselves. The modemmanager thing on Ubuntu is also extremely
annoying, as are the extra drivers needed for Windows 7 and 8. I
really need a better way of displaying errors, so the screen is an
important addition.</p>
<p>Second, colors. People love colors, and are very disappointed that
they can’t change the color of the LED matrix from the code (one can’t
help but wonder about their mental model of the underlying hardware,
but let’s not get into that too much for now). Also, while kids don’t
mind tiny screens, adults often do, even when there is nothing wrong
with their eyesight. Not to mention the buttons, which were too small
for some hands even in the large version of PewPew.</p>
<p>So I’m thinking that I really should use that 160x128 1.88” color TFT
screen. It has colors, it can display the console or menu, and it’s
still relatively cheap. It will never be as bright or visible from
distance as the large 8x8 LED matrix, but that’s not the main use
case. Of course, the problem is that pushing so many bits to the
display each frame is not fast enough for smooth animation. So let’s
also upgrade the microcontroller, and use the SAMD51 — sure, it’s more
expensive, but it’s only <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2. I think we can still fit in the magic
barrier of \)</span>10 with that. And PCBs are getting cheap too recently, so
let’s use a bigger PCB that is easier to hold.</p>
<p>So all in all, a more capable hardware with fewer hacks, for a little
higher price, but much improved convenience. Of course I started
mocking it as soon as I came back from the conference:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-165032/images/4351671563477481804.JPG" src="projects/project-165032/images/4351671563477481804.JPG" />
<p>And since I couldn’t sleep a few nights afterwards, I designed a PCB
as well:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-165032/images/3036191563477531645.png" src="projects/project-165032/images/3036191563477531645.png" />
<p>As you can see, I’m using:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PCB the size of a credit card,</p></li>
<li><p>TFT screen,</p></li>
<li><p>wider-spaced buttons,</p></li>
<li><p>same connector, but now with better descriptions,</p></li>
<li><p>same two AAA batteries,</p></li>
<li><p>only the minimum necessary parts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once it arrives, I will need to experiment with bootloaders, linker
scripts and so on to get CircuitPython to run on it, and then I will
write a version of the Pew library that simply displays 8x8 huge color
blocks on that screen. If it proves fast enough, maybe I will be even
able to replace those blocks with custom GIF images later on? Who
knows?</p>
