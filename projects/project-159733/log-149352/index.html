<h1>How Lite can PewPew be?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-lite-can-pewpew-be" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2018-07-15 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-159733</span>.</p>
<p>After designing a cheaper version of the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-21578</span> recently, I started thinking: what if instead of using a separate chip
for driving the LED matrix, I used the free pins on the MCU? And
instead of buttons use touch pads? And instead of a USB port use the
shape of the PCB? I could get the BOM literally to a few parts!</p>
<p>One problem with that: I would need 24 pins to drive the bi-color
matrix. Sure, I could add shift registers and decades and whatnot, but
then I’m back to using additional chips, and with the price of the
HT16K33, I may just as well use that. But what if I could use fewer
pins? Are there tricks for that?</p>
<p>With charlieplexing I could drive a 16×8 matrix with as few as 12 pins
(the formula is n²-n, which for 12 gives me 132 LEDs, four more than
my required 128). But you can’t charlieplex matrices with common
cathodes. <a class="reference external" href="https://wealoneonearth.blogspot.com/2013/03/design-note-charlieplexing-led-matrices.html">Well, you can</a> , but that’s not useful for square matrices. But what if I made my own
bi-color matrix on the PCB? You can get 0603 bi-color LEDs cheaply —
in fact cheaper than the equivalent matrix. Soldering them is a lot of
work by hand, but if I got it fabricated the pick-and-place machine
does all the work anyways. And it would then be flat. Like a business
card.</p>
<p>Wait a minute…</p>
<p>With so few parts it could actually be cheap enough to use as a
business card!</p>
<p>So I made this mockup:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-159733/images/7516981531610386604.png" src="projects/project-159733/images/7516981531610386604.png" />
<p>The big black hole is for a CR2032 battery — it will be sunken into
the PCB, to keep the thickness at a minimum.</p>
<p>I even started routing the matrix — for now I have routed 8×8 LEDs
with 9 pins used, and 7 pins free. Now I have two options: route the
other half the same way, using the remaining 7 free pins, and the two
debugging pins (possibly with some jumpers to disconnect them for
debugging), or redo the whole thing as a 12×11 matrix using only 12
pins, and then rearrange the LEDs back to 16×8. Of course the second
option would be much better, but I’m not sure I have the stamina for
that. If I go for the 2×8×8 approach, I might also separate the two
colors — we will see how it goes.</p>
