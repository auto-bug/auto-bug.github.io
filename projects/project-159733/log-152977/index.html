<p>I took a few PewPew prototypes to the Maker Faire Zürich, to show them
off but also to have them tested by the actual target audience. I
think they were a success, because we always had a couple of kids at
our table playing them, even though the game selection wasn’t that
good (mostly snake, some tetris). But I got to see how people handle
them, to test how long they last on battery power (around 14 hours on
two AAA batteries) and, last but not least, they went through a crash
course of actually being used by a lot of living humans. I’m happy to
report that there were no injuries or defects on either side.</p>

<p>(Sorry for the silly face on the photo.)</p>
<p>In the worse news, I finally didn’t have the time to write the code to
control the robot. I naively thought until the last moment that I will
have some free time during the event. Nope. It was eight hours of
people talking to me non-stop. Which I guess is good, because it means
they were interested. But no robots. Well, I had some of my robots
walking around, but not controlled with PewPew. Maybe next time.</p>
