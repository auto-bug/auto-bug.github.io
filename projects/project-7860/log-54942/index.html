<h1>Crazy Custom Colors<a class="headerlink" href="#crazy-custom-colors" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-03-15 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-7860"><span class="std std-ref">Nyan Board</span></a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, DirtyPCBs announced a new service: <a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/store/panels/details/1/mystery_color">Mystery Color PCB Group Buy</a>  <a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/store/panels/details/1/mystery_color"></a> . The idea is similar to what OSHPark does – you get 3 PCBs and get
charged by the surface area. But there is a twist – they are going to
experiment with various soldermask color combinations, and you never
know what you get.</p>
<p>I decided to try this, and made an order for the single Nyan Board –
because I thought it would be fun to have it in a crazy color. The
example PCB on the picture is pink, so I expected something flashy. I
made my order on February 05, 2017. Today is March 15, 2017 and the PCBs arrived. I have to admit that
this is a bit longer than I expected.</p>
<p>But never mind that, what are the new exciting colors? I have to admit
that I am a little bit disappointed here too. Here’s a photo:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-7860/images/6059241489574405659.jpg" src="projects/project-7860/images/6059241489574405659.jpg" />
<p>First of all, the boards are mostly naked FR4. The soldermask is
present only where there is either copper or silkscreen – all the
other areas are simply unpainted. That pretty much ruins everything.\</p>
<p>The soldermask itself is a kind of body color orange, which might be
interesting for human figures or faces, if only you knew the color in
advance and could somehow get the whole board covered in it. The
silkscreen is pretty much standard unexciting black.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I ordered 3 boards, and I received 11, which is a
bit strange, but I guess a good deal for $4 with shipping.</p>
<section id="update">
<h2>Update:<a class="headerlink" href="#update" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>After talking with DirtyPCBs, I examined my boards closely, and
realized how wrong and unfair I was. The soldermask is not_missing_ from between the copper traces. And it’s not orange – that orange is
just the color of copper traces covered with it. Yes.**The soldermask is transparent!**This opens a lot of possibilities for novel designs, although I still
have to say that it would look much better if the FR4 underneath was
some other color than the default.</p>
<p>Also, they refunded it to me completely, and now I feel like a
complete jerk.</p>
