<h1>Different Power Sources<a class="headerlink" href="#different-power-sources" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>

<p>Power source is a hard problem for any walking or flying robots.
Unlike the robots that roll on wheels (or tracks), walkers have to
carry its own weight, and the battery can be easily the heaviest part
of the robot. They also tend to draw quite a lot of current for their
many actuators, so that further limits the choices.</p>
<p>For the base Tote, I went with a single-cell LiPo battery, mostly
because they have the best weight-to-power ratio, and they are
relatively easy to get, either from hobby model shops, from
electronics shops, or from discarded cellphones, electric
toothbrushes, etc. but there are other possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Alkaline batteries</strong> are well known by the robot experts as absolutely the crappiest
batteries you could use for your robot. Not only they are heavy, but
also the current you can draw from them is almost nothing, and they
will discharge pretty quickly, after which you can simply throw them
away. So can Tote be powered with alkaline batteries? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>As you can see, you can, but not for very long. But it’s nice to see
that Tote can actually lift them. That means that I could probably
swap them for some<strong>NiMH</strong> or<strong>NiCd</strong> rechargeable batteries, and it would be all good. Let’s see!</p>

<p>That actually went pretty well! Apart from some weight-shifting
problems, I would probably need to find a better way of attaching
them. Also, using AAA cells instead of AA would improve the weight,
but unfortunately I don’t have any AAA rechargeable batteries on me at
the moment. Finally, a<strong>LiPo</strong> battery salvaged from a broken power bank, for comparison.</p>

<p>That huge battery should keep it going whole day.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at some more advanced hack. For an experiment with
force-sensing servos, that I will describe separately at some point, I
needed the voltage given to the servos to be constant, so that I would
get consistent readings. The obvious solution is to add a switching
voltage regulator (an<strong>UBEC</strong>), and I actually thought about that when designing Tote’s printed
circuit board, so there is a place for it:\</p>
<img alt="projects/project-6050/images/7729521433080757411.jpg" src="projects/project-6050/images/7729521433080757411.jpg" />
<p>It’s conveniently located just after the power switch and the voltage-
monitoring circuit, so that those two will still work correctly. One
problem that I had is that this regulator needs higher voltage to
regulate it_down_to the voltage desired, so I needed to use a battery with higher
voltage. So I used a 2S<strong>LiFePo4</strong>battery here. What is that? They are all the rage these days among the
power flashlight geeks. They are similar to LiPo batteries, except
they are much stabler both chemically and electrically, giving pretty
good 3.3V voltage and not exploding if you as much as look at them
funny. Unfortunately, you need a special charger for them – the LiPo
charging modules are no good.</p>
<p>Of course, for experiments on your desktop, you can always just plug
the robot into a bench power supply, and have it drag a cable behind.
It’s actually more convenient than having to recharge or swap
batteries all the time. Unfortunately you can’t simply power this
robot from your computer’s USB. It needs way more power than the 500mA
the USB standard specifies.</p>
<p>That concludes my experiments with power sources. As you can see, you
have a lot of choices.</p>
