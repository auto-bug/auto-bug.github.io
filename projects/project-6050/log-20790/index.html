<h1>Distance Sensor, Second Try<a class="headerlink" href="#distance-sensor-second-try" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2015-07-10 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-6050"><span class="std std-ref">Tote</span></a>.</p>
<p>Seonsors are very important for robots, and a distance sensor is one
of the most useful ones that you can install, as it gives the robot an
approximation of vision. I tried to use an ultrasound distance sensor
with Tote before, and failed miserably. This time I’m going to use an
infra-red distance sensor.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://sharp-world.com/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0a21yk_e.pdf">Sharp 2Y0A21</a>  <a class="reference external" href="http://sharp-world.com/products/device/lineup/data/pdf/datasheet/gp2y0a21yk_e.pdf"></a>  [pdf] sensor is probably one of the most popular hobby robot sensors
out there, right after the ultrasonic one. But it takes 5V as the
power supply. Will it work at our robot’s 3.3V? Let’s find out!</p>

<p>Connecting this sensor is easy. There are three cables: red for power,
black for ground and yellow for the sensor output. The voltage on the
output wire will vary depending on the distance being read by the
sensor, so we have to connect it to an analog pin. The easiest way to
use that sensor with Tote is to plug the wires into the I²C pin
header, as both of the I²C pins of the Pro Mini are, by coincidence,
also analog pins, and we have convenient 3.3V power and ground it
there too. The photo above shows how to connect it.</p>
<p>Now, the first test. Does it even start when powered with 3.3V? There
is an easy way to check any infra-red devices – just look at them
through a digital camera. The camera sensors are much more sensitive
to infra-red light than our eyes, and will show you a shining LED.
Test passed.</p>
<p>Next, let’s try to get some readings and calibrate the sensor. I’m
powering it with out-of-spec power, so anything written in the
datasheet will most likely be completely wrong. We need to do our own
calibration. We can do this with this extremely complex Arduino
sketch:</p>

<p>It will basically repeatedly read the analog pin value and print it on
the serial line. We can use the Arduino IDE’s serial monitor to see
those values. A quick test and yay, we are getting readings, and they
are different depending on the distance. So far so good.</p>

<p>The photo above shows my testing rig. A long ruler, the sensor taped
to one end, and a reasonably reflective white object. Note, that the
power line from the USB2TTL is disconnected and the Pro Mini is
running on the battery power, so that it gets to regulate its own 3.3V
for the sensor, and doesn’t rely on the power from the computer. Here
are the measurements I did, plotted on a chart:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/6856891436554041118.png" src="../../../_images/6856891436554041118.png" />
<p>As you can see, the sensor has a much shorter useful range than the
80cm it gets on 5V. At about 35cm it starts to break already. But
that’s fine, 35cm is a lot for our robot. We also won’t need exact
measurements, so no need to convert those numbers to centimeters – we
will just read the chart for setting our limits.Next, let’s actually attach the sensor to our robot and make it do
something. Of course, the simplest thing it can do is to stop before
it hits an obstacle.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/3268571436554231854.jpg" src="../../../_images/3268571436554231854.jpg" />
<p>I used adhesive tape to attach the sensor to the front of the robot. I
might come up with a better way of doing it in the future, but this is
good enough for now. Now let’s add some code that does the stopping.
We just add a <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/src/52697d7f12c87825ac4579f371ccd22bdd2151bc/start/sharp.ino?at=sharp"><em>sharp.ino</em></a>  file, with corresponding_sharp.h_, and call it all from <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/src/9aa456eb0395f03c488d6ef61da6a31f7e39ff4d/start/start.ino?at=sharp"><em>start.ino</em></a> . And let’s see the results:</p>

<p>It works as expected, the robot consistently stops at about 15cm from
the obstacle. That’s it for today, in the future I will show how to
code a simple obstacle-avoiding algorithm, and then how to make the
robot follow you around.</p>
