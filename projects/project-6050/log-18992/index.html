<h1>Proprioception on the Cheap<a class="headerlink" href="#proprioception-on-the-cheap" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2015-06-04 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-6050"><span class="std std-ref">Tote</span></a>.</p>
<p>Remember that time when you sat on your leg for some time, and it got
numb, and when you got up, it felt all wooden and walking was like
walking on stilts? That’s how most walking robots feel. What happened
is your nerves got squished and blocked a little, and you lost your <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception">sense of proprioception</a>  – the position and forces of your limbs. Now you know why robots
that don’t have force and position sensors on them have such a hard
time walking!</p>
<p>What if we could add this sense to our robot? It would still be blind
and deaf, but at least it would have a sense of self. It could feel
its way around, knowing if a leg is standing on the floor or floating
in the air, knowing if there is something blocking its movement. If we
got smart with programming, we could even make it “obedient” and go in
the direction you push it, just like this robot:</p>
<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="None" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMVO6rI5mL4"></iframe>
<p>OK, well, maybe not as well. After all, we have limited budget and
time. Plus programming the algorithm that calculates the overall force
from the feedback from all the joint could be a challenge…</p>
<p>But at the minimum we could make our robot stop when it arrives at the
edge of the table and tries to put one of its legs in the abyss beyond
it. Or when we pick it up.</p>
<p>So how do we do it? We could attach additional sensors to the legs –
encoders for the position and pressure sensors for touch and force. I
checked the parts – they are either expensive or problematic to mount
on such a robot. But wait, doesn’t the hobby servo already know its
position? Why not use that?</p>
<p>The first approach was to use an additional wire added to the servo’s
potentiometer to read its position. I used this <a class="reference external" href="http://letsmakerobots.com/content/sensing-your-servos-position">excellent guide on modifying the servo</a> . It worked. Kinda. But not as well as I hoped. The problem is that to
deduce what force is applied on the leg, I need to calculate the
difference between the desired position of the servo and the actual
position. This difference is going to be small, because the servo’s
electronics are working hard to correct it. Turns out that they are
smaller than the noise, even if I add filtering capacitors and
software filters. Oh well.</p>
<p>Then I realized that the servo’s electronics is actually already
calculating the force, for its own purposes. Can I somehow plug into
that? What if instead of reading the pot’s position, I would simply
read the voltage that the servo is applying to its motor? Turns out
that this works quite well, at least with the SG90 servos that I have.
Here’s an experiment that I performed to test a “compliant motion”
servo:</p>

<p>I soldered an additional wire to the servo’s motor, like this:\</p>

<p>I also had to make the hole in the cover a little bit larger, to fit
the extra wire:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-6050/images/6186631433409502496.jpg" src="projects/project-6050/images/6186631433409502496.jpg" />
<p>Now, just connect the extra wire to one of the free analog pins on the
Pro Mini:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-6050/images/407621433409552947.jpg" src="projects/project-6050/images/407621433409552947.jpg" />
<p>As you can see, the robot also uses a voltage regulator that I
described in <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote-affordable-spider-robot/log/18738-different-power-sources">the previous log</a> . That’s because I need the voltage readings from the motors to be
consistent, and not depend on how much juice is left in the battery.Now just a simple addition to the walking algorithm. Every time you
put your leg down, wait for the servo to get there, and then read the
force from it. If the force is too small, stop. I also made all the
other legs move up slightly just before the reading, to shift the
weight more to the leg that we are interested in. The result is not
very pretty yet, but I’m sure I can tweak it to look better:</p>

<p>With some tricks, I might even be able to make it walk on uneven
terrain without additional endstop switches at the ends of the legs.</p>

<p>A friend of mine ran some of those servos through an oscilloscope, to
see how the voltage on both of the motor wires looks like. Here’s the
servo going one way, stopping for a moment, and then going the other
way:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-6050/images/6523361433962373953.png" src="projects/project-6050/images/6523361433962373953.png" />
<p>You can see that when stopped, the motor floats at about 2.3V, and
goes up to 5.7V or almost to 0V when moving. You can also see that
there is quite a lot of oscillating at the end, when it overshoots and
corrects:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-6050/images/1875031433962508897.png" src="projects/project-6050/images/1875031433962508897.png" />
<p>An interesting thing happens when you reverse the direction without
stopping:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-6050/images/6556091433962558341.png" src="projects/project-6050/images/6556091433962558341.png" />
<p>One of the motor leads gets high voltage long before the other gets
low. Since what drives the motor is the difference, this gives the
motor some time to stop and reverse, before applying the full force.</p>
