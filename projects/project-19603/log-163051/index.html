<h1>One More Version<a class="headerlink" href="#one-more-version" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2019-05-08 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-19603"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini Tote</span></a>.</p>
<p>An advantage of having several similar projects, some long-term and
some faster, is that the research and innovation you test in the fast
projects can trickle back into the slower ones. This is one such
example. When I started with this, I was mostly using ready modules
for most things, and the PCB was just a way to hold things together.
After some intensive development of <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-27629/#project-27629"><span class="std std-ref">µGame</span></a> , <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-159733/#project-159733"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew Standalone</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-158981/#project-158981"><span class="std std-ref">Kubik M0</span></a> , however, I figured out some ways of doing some of those things
better with discrete components and with better mechanical design. So
it’s time to make a new version that will include all those
improvements.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-19603/images/3201671557267311761.png" src="projects/project-19603/images/3201671557267311761.png" />
<p>There has been changes. The D1 Mini footprint and the servo sockets
have been rotated 90° degrees, so that the front of the robot is now
to the left. That means that the battery is now sideways, and there is
more room under the robot to fit the servos when the legs are in
extreme positions (it will still require cutting off those “ears” from
the servos). The body is still 5×5cm, but there are all those leg
parts around it, so now the whole PCB is 10×10cm — which reflects the
current reality of ordering cheap PCBs. It’s the same idea as in <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-158981/#project-158981"><span class="std std-ref">Kubik M0</span></a> , however, the feet now have footprints for switches, so we can detect
ground easily.</p>
<p>There is no room for the battery protection and charging module
anymore, instead there is a charging and a protection circuit directly
on the PCB. I’m using a double switch for power, because when it
switches off the power from battery, it also switches on the charging
— this way I can use one USB port for both programming and charging.
The servo sockets are rotated now, and stretched along the battery
holder, so that they can go on the bottom of the robot and still leave
enough room for the servos to rotate. I also added back some small
prototyping area at the front of the robot, for mounting sensors, and
also on the legs.</p>
<p>Otherwise it’s all standard stuff: a PCA9685 chip for PWM, a LiPo
battery for power, and a socket for a D1 Mini to control it all.\</p>
