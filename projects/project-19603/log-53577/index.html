<h1>Battery Protection<a class="headerlink" href="#battery-protection" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-02-20 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-19603"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini Tote</span></a>.</p>
<p>I did some more work both on this project and on the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-19921/#project-19921"><span class="std std-ref">SpiderWing</span></a> . I debugged the leg IK code finally – it was all about reversed
servo directions. I also tested different parameters for the creep
gait, and I can tell it will take some time to tune this properly.</p>
<p>However, in the process of doing that, I ran the LiPo batteries on
those robots to dangerously low voltage levels. Fortunately I noticed
and re-charged them quickly, so hopefully the damage is not that big,
but this made me actually go looking at the schematics and reading
datasheets.</p>
<p>It turns out that neither the Adafruit Feather not the D1 Mini Battery
Shield have a built-in overdischarge protection, as I assumed they
would. They only have a charger and a voltage regulator (a boost
converter in the case of the D1 Mini). They assume, apparently, that
the battery has the protection circuit built-in. Of course the 16340
batteries that I’m using have no such thing. So it’s back to the
drawing board.</p>
<p>I considered various options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>add the battery protection circuitry on the board (in form of a ready
chip)</p></li>
<li><p>add the battery protection as a ready module</p></li>
<li><p>add a battery charger module with the protection circuit included</p></li>
<li><p>add a voltage divider and connect it to an analog pin of the board,
and monitor voltage in software in Python</p></li>
<li><p>add a voltage divider and connect it to an analog pin on the ATmega,
and monitor voltage in software in C on the servo controller</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of those have their advantages and disadvantages, and I think I’m
going to choose different options for the two different designs.</p>
<p>For the D1 Mini Tote, I don’t care much about how complex the board
will become – it requires soldering of SMD chips anyways, so if I
ever make this available, that will probably be with the board pre-
soldered. In that situation, a hardware battery protection is a better
thing – it works even if there is a bug in your software, or when
that crashes. I also don’t like the battery shield very much. So I
decided to go with a battery charger module with a built-in voltage
protection on it. I had a few of those on hand already, and I tested
them briefly – they seem to work just fine. So I reworked the PCB to
include the pins for the charging module, and to not require the
battery shield anymore. There will still be a separate USB socket for
charging – there is no way I can access the data pins on the D1 Mini
to connect the sockets together, and the robot will still have to be
switched on for charging – I have bad experiences with leaving
anything connected to the battery with the switch in the off position:
I want the switch to cut the battery completely.</p>
<p>For the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-19921/#project-19921"><span class="std std-ref">SpiderWing</span></a> , I went with a voltage divider initially. It would be perfect to just
connect it to A6 or A7 – the analog-only pins that I’m not using
anyways – of the ATmega, however, they are not broken out in the DIP
package. So now I have a choice between using one of the servo pins
(which I really could, since I have 8 more than I really need), or
using the Feather’s analog pin and run the check in Python. I made
some PCB designs for both approaches, but just now, while I was
writing all this, I had another idea. The ATmega includes internal
reference voltage that I can measure against the voltage the chip is
powered from. That means, that if I power the ATmega directly from the
battery, I can check the battery voltage without the need for any
extra components or pins. Well, OK, I will need a filtering capacitor
then, because the servos make a lot of noise, but it should work.
Unfortunately, right now I’m powering the ATmega from the 3.3V pin of
the Feather – because it’s nice, stabilized and filtered. In any
case, I would really prefer to have the check in the ATmega, and not
on the Feather – it’s more robust that way against users uploading
their own programs.</p>
