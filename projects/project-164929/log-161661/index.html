<p>Published on 2019-04-11 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-164929"><span class="std std-ref">PyBadge Hacking</span></a>.</p>
<p>Handling buttons on a game console requires some special
consideration, since it is going to affect how responsive the games
feel. Human touch can discriminate really small timing differences,
and we definitely don’t want to miss any button presses — human input
is sacred for computers.</p>
<p>Since you will usually have quite a few buttons — at least 5, for
directions nad fire, and possibly more — there is a big temptation to
save some pins by using trick in how the buttons are connected. You
may connect them in a matrix, or even charlie-plex them, you can
connect them to an analog pin with different voltage dividers, you can
use different capacitors and rely on the signal length, or you can use
capacitive touch pads to save on components. Whatever you do, there is
one problem with all those tricks — they require some logic in the
software to work. Even if you have your buttons connected directly to
pins, you want them to be either handled by a pin change interrupt, or
scanned in background in a consistent manner.\</p>
<p>One way to handle the buttons in the background without imposing too
much work on the people programming your device is to include all the
required code in a library, and use interrupts — so that they don’t
have to follow strict requirements about calling a polling function in
regular intervals, etc. This lets them write code that blocks, uses
delays and so on — which is much easier to understand for a beginner.
That is why I wrote the “gamepad” module for CircuitPython — so that I
can use it for buttons on the #µGame.</p>
<p>Another approach is to outsource the task to a dedicated chip, such as
the HT16K33 on the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-21578/#project-21578"><span class="std std-ref">PewPew FeatherWing</span></a> or a custom programmed ATtiny24 on the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-19371/#project-19371"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini X-Pad Shield</span></a> — they can do the scanning and the debouncing for your, and you just
need a small snippet of code to read the currently buffered button
state from them over I²C. Easy!</p>
<p>Now, back to the PyBadge. That device uses a 74HC165 shift register
for the buttons. This is a problem, because it doesn’t buffer the
button presses — every time you get the data from it, you get the
state of buttons at the moment the data was latched, when you started
the communication — and not all the presses since you read it last
time, which is what you get with the HT16K33 and ATtiny. You can read
that state in Python easily enough by bit-banging:</p>

<p>But in your game you would have to do it constantly, very fast — and
at the same time run all the animations and calculations. Not very
convenient, and if any of your things takes more time than
anticipated, you are going to miss button presses. That makes the
experience very frustrating.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that shift register is very fast — you can get the data
out of it in no time at all. So I modified the “gamepad” module a bit,
to make it also work with a shift register. Every 8ms it polls the
shift register for the current button state, and saves the button
presses in a buffer, which is emptied when you query it. This way you
can use the same code on the PyBadge as you would on the µGame, just
the initialization is different.</p>
