<h1>Take Over the Wold Already<a class="headerlink" href="#take-over-the-wold-already" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2018-06-10 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-158981"><span class="std std-ref">Kubik M0</span></a>.</p>
<p>I decided to take all that I have learned in the recent years with all
the versions of  <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-6050/#project-6050"><span class="std std-ref">Tote</span></a> and other projects, and turn it into a robot kit to sell on Tindie.
While the previous work focused on making it as simple as possible to
build it yourself and possibly modify the design, this time I’m going
to focus on optimizing for a kit. The design will be much more
integrated, with all that can be done in advance already done. I’m
going to optimize for the cost, ease of production, shipping, ease of
assembly, robustness, and fun. Of course I still want to make it easy
to hack and extend, but that is going to be a secondary concern.</p>
<p>Optimizing for cost and ease of production means that the development
boards, as used in <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-19921/#project-19921"><span class="std std-ref">SpiderWing</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-19603/#project-19603"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini Tote</span></a> have to go — not only they add to cost, but also they increase the
risks, because I don’t have any guarantee they will still be available
in two years in reasonable prices. So it has to be a single integrated
circuit board, with a minimal amount of through-hole parts, with all
the parts on one side, and fitting in either the 5x5cm or 10x10cm
limit.</p>
<p>Optimizing for shipping means that it can’t be sold assembled — the
box would simply be too big. So the kit has to be flat, preferably
less than 2cm. There is no chance I’m going to ship a battery, so it
has to use a standard battery that is easy to get. And the servos are
simply too heavy to ship, so that will need to be sourced separately
too.</p>
<p>Ease of assembly means that everything has to be pre-soldered.
Soldering is not hard, but requires specialized tools and people are
afraid of it. It also means that it has to come pre-programmed, and
that there needs to be a simple procedure for calibrating the legs. I
would love to avoid glue if possible, but we will see how that works.</p>
<p>Robustness to mistakes is important, because I have limited time I can
devote to support — ideally it should just work, and if it doesn’t,
there should be a simple procedure to follow to figure out what is
wrong. The fear of having to support hundreds of people whose robots
don’t work is what stopped me from selling a Tote kit on Tindie so
far, but now I decided to try my luck. It doesn’t mean I can’t try to
make it as easy as possible for me.</p>
<p>Finally, it has to be fun out of the box, otherwise people will just
assemble it, see that it works, and put it back into the drawer. If
it’s fun, there is a good chance of someone deciding to hack it.
Because of that, it will ship programmed as a remote-controlled toy,
possibly with several modes — walking, dancing, balancing, etc. But of
course it’s not just a toy, and it will be easy to program it and add
custom behavior.</p>
