<h1>Improved Legs<a class="headerlink" href="#improved-legs" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2018-08-03 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-158981</span>.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of having the legs made out of PCB is that you
can easily put things on them. Like, for example, switches that detect
when the leg is touching the ground. I didn’t include that in the
original design, because I was a bit in a hurry, but that’s not a
problem, since I can make a separate set of legs easily.</p>
<p>It’s a bit problematic to find the right kind of switch for this. For
one, it has to be edge-mounted, but more importantly, it has to
require very little strength. Regular “tactswitch” buttons are useless
for that, but if you look around carefully, you will find something
that is labeled “card detection switch” — those switches are supposed
to detect when something, such as an SD card, is inserted into a slot.
As such, they are rather sensitive, requiring very little force to be
pressed. And they are usually in the correct orientation.</p>
<p>One such switch is the Panasonic ESE22MH27 that I happen to have in my
drawer. A quick search for images reveals this footprint image:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-158981/images/1175331533286601499.png" src="projects/project-158981/images/1175331533286601499.png" />
<p>So I quickly made a PCB with the footprint, and added some prototyping
area to the leg, for good measure:</p>

<p>One annoyance is that I need 4 of those, but OSHPark makes them in
batches of 3, so I need to order 6. At least I will have some extras
to break.</p>
