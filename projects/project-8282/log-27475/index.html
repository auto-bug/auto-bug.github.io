<h1>Use a Pro Micro in a Keyboard<a class="headerlink" href="#use-a-pro-micro-in-a-keyboard" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2015-11-02 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-8282"><span class="std std-ref">Alpen Clack</span></a>.</p>
<p>So you want to build your own keyboard (or keyboard-like device), but
you are not sure what to use for the brains and how to connect and
program it? I will describe what I came up with for the <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-8282"><span class="std std-ref">Alpen Clack</span></a>  keyboard.</p>
<p>The ATmega32u4 microcontroller is an excellent choice for any HID
device, such a mouse, a joystick or a keyboard. That’s mostly because
it has hardware USB support, so you don’t have to muck about with
unreliable and hacky bit-banged VUSB. There are three popular boards
with that microcontroller: Arduino Leonardo, Teensy 2.0, and Pro Micro
(not to be confused with Pro Mini, which uses ATmega328). Arduino
Leonardo is too big for our needs. Teensy 2.0 is quite expensive. Pro
Micro can be had for about $4 in singles from the usual oriental
sources. Sounds like a winner. Let’s look at the pinout:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-8282/images/3499681446499782805.png" src="projects/project-8282/images/3499681446499782805.png" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>According to this diagram, we have 18 usable pins. An 18-key keyboard
is not very useful. Can we somehow connect more keys? Turns out we
can, by using a <a class="reference external" href="http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_Key_Matrices_Works/">key matrix</a> . We basically make rows and columns, and put switches on the
crossings. Then we scan that repeatedly to figure out which ones are
pressed. We add diodes, so that the pressed keys won’t interfere with
each other. Simple.</p>
<p>So, with 18 pins, the largest matrix we can get is a square 9×9.
That’s 81 keys. Hmm, that may be fine for those tiny, chocolate bar
keyboards, but a modern PC keyboard has 105 keys. Even if we ditch the
keypad, like I did in my keyboard, that only removes 17 keys. We are
still 7 keys short!</p>
<p>Wait, what does it say about LEDs at the bottom there? Two more
independent pins? Great, we only have to remove the two resistors and
solder wires in their place, and we have 20 pins for our disposal.
That gives us the largest matrix of 10×10, so 100 keys. Still not
enough for the full layout, but should be fine for a tenkeyless
keyboard.</p>
<p>Next, programming the thing. After a short search, I found the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard">TMK Keyboard</a>  firmware, which is just perfect for our needs. All we need to do is
to copy the “onekey” example keyboard, and modify the_config.h_,_ keymap.c_ and_matrix.c_files to fit our keyboard.</p>
<p>In_config.h_, we have to set the correct number of rows and columns. I used 8
columns and 11 rows in my keyboard, which gave me the 88 keys I needed
(actually 87). You can also change some other options here and in the_Makefile_.</p>
<p>Next, the hard part –<em>matrix.c</em>. You will need to define four functions:<em>init_cols, read_cols, unselect_rows_and</em> select_row_. You can look at all the examples included in the repository to get
an idea what they need to do. Basically,<em>init_cols</em> sets all the column pins in INPUT mode with internal pull-up
resistors. It’s called once at the start. Next, the_read_cols_ function reads the state of all those column pins, and reports it as
a single byte (or more, if you have more than 8 columns, but see
below). The_unselect_rows_ function sets all the row pins to floating, and finally the_select_row_ function sets the specified row pin to low. That’s it.</p>
<p>One note about having more than 8 columns: while the code looks like
it should support it, I didn’t manage to get that to work. I’m not too
worried, because I only needed 8 in the end, but if you need more, you
will probably need to copy the_matrix_scan_ function from one of the larger examples to get it to work.</p>
<p>Lastly, you need to define the key map – basically to tell the
firmware which key is which. You do that in_keymap.c,_by defining an array of arrays of arrays… I mean, an array of
layers, each layer being an array of rows, each row being an array of
columns, each column being an array of keys. The layers let you setup
cool effects with special keys and such, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/blob/master/doc/keymap.md">keymap documentation</a>  for details.</p>
<p>Lastly, we need to modify the_Makefile_ for our board. I used_Makefile.pjrc_, because the default one doesn’t support N-key rollover yet. Set the
following variables:</p>
<div class="highlight-makefile notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">MCU</span> <span class="o">=</span> atmega32u4
<span class="nv">OPT_DEFS</span> <span class="o">+=</span> -DBOOTLOADER_SIZE<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">512</span>
<span class="nv">PROGRAM_CMD</span> <span class="o">=</span> avrdude -p <span class="k">$(</span>MCU<span class="k">)</span> -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c avr109 -U flash:w:<span class="k">$(</span>TARGET<span class="k">)</span>.hex
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now you are ready to program your board. Connect a switch between the
GND and RST pins, connect the board to USB and press the switch two
times quickly. That puts the board into programming mode. Now run “<em>make -f Makefile.pjrc program</em>”, and it should compile and burn the firmware to your board. After
that it will be visible in “lsusb” command as whatever ID you set in
the_config.h_ file, and shorting any row pin with any column pin should produce key
presses. Now you can solder the board into your matrix, and you are
done.</p>
