<h1>A Quick Tour Around the IS31FL373x Chips<a class="headerlink" href="#a-quick-tour-around-the-is31fl373x-chips" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-07-03 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-20941"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini Matrix Deluxe Shields</span></a>.</p>
<p>There is a whole family of those, and they are all controlled in a
similar way. Of course all the details are in the datasheets, and in
theory this is all the information you need, but in practice I think
it’s useful to have a general bird’s-eye view of the whole thing.</p>
<p>The chips are controlled over I2C and I’m not going to explain that.
Uncharacteristically, it has two additional pins related to the I2C
protocol, apart from the usual SDA and SCL: those are the IIC-RST,
which can be used to reset the part of the chip that handles
communication, in case your bus gets stuck in some weird state
preventing communication, and VIO, which sets the voltage that you
want to use for the communication. I usually just pull the IIC-RST
down and the VIO up.</p>
<p>The higher-level protocol is also quite simple. You have 8-bit
registers with b-bit addresses, divided into pages. To read or write a
register from the current page, you simply write that register’s
number, and then either read with a repeated start or write. That’s
pretty much standard.  Changing a page is bit more involved, because
it’s apparently potentially dangerous: first you need to unlock the
page register by writing the magic value 0xc5 to the register 0xfe,
and then you can write the page number to the register 0xfd.</p>
<p>There are four pages.</p>
<p>Page 0 is dedicated to configuring which LEDs are being used, and to
reading results of the open/short detection. At the minimum you need
to write 1s to the bits corresponding to the LEDs that are actually
connected to the chip (your matrix may be smaller than the chip’s
maximum). You only do it once at the beginning.\</p>
<p>Page 1 contains information about brightness of each individual LED.
That’s where you actually draw your pixels. Of course, the default
brightness is 0, so you need to write something there to actually see
anything.</p>
<p>Page 2 controls blinking, or rather “breathing”, as they call the
fade-in fade-out animation that you can set on any of the individual
LEDs, in 3 different variations of timing. You don’t need to touch
anything here. Oh, and for this to have any effect, you need to set
the B_EN bit in the register 0x00 on page 3.</p>
<p>And finally page 3 is configuration. At the minimum, you need to write
0x01 to the register 0x00 here to enable the chip, and some value to
the register 0x01 setting the global brightness (because of course it
defaults to 0 and you wouldn’t see anything). The rest is about
configuring the blink timings, pull-up and pull-down resistors on the
LEDs, and a software reset – not that interesting.</p>
<p>So the workflow of the driver is usually as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Set which LEDs you are using by writing to registers on page 0.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to page 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable the chip and set the global brightness.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to page 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually draw your graphics by writing to the registers on page 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That should get you started. Of course, there are lots more small
details and possibilities there.</p>
