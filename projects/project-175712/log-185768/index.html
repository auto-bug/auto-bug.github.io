<h1>Last One, Promise<a class="headerlink" href="#last-one-promise" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2020-11-04 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-175712"><span class="std std-ref">Kamina Keyboard</span></a>.</p>
<p>So I finished <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-174982/#project-174982"><span class="std std-ref">Turbot Keyboard</span></a> and while it is a fine keyboard, it turned out to be less convenient
to me than the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-174917/#project-174917"><span class="std std-ref">Dorsch 48k Keyboard</span></a> . The reason for that is that it’s too big, meaning that I have to
move my hands to reach keys like Esc or Backspace. Turns out that a
large part of the magical touch-typing improvement I got with the
Planck layout is not from it being ortholinear (though it certainly
helps a lot), but from it being so small, that you don’t move your
hands sideways.</p>
<p>Once I realized that, the solution is obvious: I need to take the
Planck, break it in two so that I can have my hands farther apart, and
add a number row, so that it’s easier to program with it. So I went to
the keyboard layout editor and made this:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175712/images/7667371604524629931.png" src="projects/project-175712/images/7667371604524629931.png" />
<p>From there it was the usual process, I made a PCB with a SAMD21 MCU on
it, and ordered it:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175712/images/6743081604524677595.png" src="projects/project-175712/images/6743081604524677595.png" />
<p>The switches were on order already. I also found another set of
keycaps that are compatible with the low-profile switches, and ordered
them too. Today everything arrived all once, so I began assembling.</p>
<p>The keycaps turned out to be a little bit too high and too small for
my preference:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175712/images/4486221604524794359.jpg" src="projects/project-175712/images/4486221604524794359.jpg" />
<p>So I swapped them with the PBT keycaps I had on my <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-175043/#project-175043"><span class="std std-ref">Flatreus Keyboard</span></a> :</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175712/images/4675481604524843123.jpg" src="projects/project-175712/images/4675481604524843123.jpg" />
<p>Then I had to use a few transparent key caps I had lying around,
because I didn’t have enough of the PBT ones:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175712/images/120481604524903285.jpg" src="projects/project-175712/images/120481604524903285.jpg" />
<p>Once I had the keyboard all programmed and working, and I knew it’s
going to replace my Planck as my daily driver, I decided to swap the
key caps with the Planck, so that now both of them have consistent
keycaps:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-175712/images/7632841604524976811.jpg" src="projects/project-175712/images/7632841604524976811.jpg" />
<p>And that’s pretty much it. I’m using that keyboard right now and it’s
great so far. I will probably keep it for a long time.</p>
