<h1>Working on Version 3<a class="headerlink" href="#working-on-version-3" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2023-12-12 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-175712"><span class="std std-ref">Kamina Keyboard</span></a>.</p>
<p>We had recently a keyboard enthusiasts meetup in my city, and a
surprising number of people were interested in the Kamina v2 keyboard
– it seems to be a good stepping stone between a traditional keyboard
and a proper ergo board. However, the fact that it uses a bare SAMD21
chip, which was hard to obtain due to chip shortage, has a scary
small-pitch QFN footprint and requires a special programmer to flash
the bootloader makes it difficult to build by beginning electronics
hobbyists. Or at least the less confident ones.</p>
<p>I also noticed that if I made the extra column breakable, it could
easily be converted into a proper ergo board, very similar to the Klap
v4 keyboard I’m using as my main driver. Especially if I made the
switches hot-swappable, it could be a very good intro into the world
of ergonomic keyboards.</p>
<p>But how to make it easier to assemble? Simple, just use the raspberry
pi pico microcontroller board for the brains, similar to how I did it
for the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-10408/#project-10408"><span class="std std-ref">Steno Keyboard</span></a> project. It’s cheap, and there are easily enough pins. You can even
get clones with additional features, like a USB-C connector or a small
display! The rest is just soldering the hot-swap sockets, and all the
diodes. Shouldn’t be too hard.</p>
<p>I started with some mock-ups in Inkscape. I initially want to also
make the top row breakable. Oh, and I forgot, I also want to make it
so that you use two of the same PCBs, one flipped over, so that they
are cheaper to manufacture. Here is one of the steps:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/7857011702341170895.png" src="../../../_images/7857011702341170895.png" />
<p>I also decided to not use Fritzing this time, as the stupid “donation”
thing makes it difficult for people to download and install it.
Instead, I switched to EasyEDA, because it runs in the browser and so
people don’t have to install anything. It also makes it very easy to
order the boards, which is also a big plus. I spent a day fiddling
with the design, and this is what I came up with:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/2432381702341390253.png" src="../../../_images/2432381702341390253.png" />
<img alt="../../../_images/4041971702341390418.png" src="../../../_images/4041971702341390418.png" />
<p>There is a bunch of 0Ω resistors, which should only be soldered on the
bottom of the board, leaving the ones on the top open – to avoid
shorting the pins of the microcontroller board that lie opposite each
other. The five-pin header provides additional structural strength,
and shares the row lines between the halves. The last column is
breakable, and I even added two more keys in the center of the board,
for those of us with exceptionally dexterous thumbs.</p>
