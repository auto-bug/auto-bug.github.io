<p>A few weeks ago I ordered custom transparent stickers for the backside
of the front plate for the case, so that they would mask away a part
of the display, but more importantly, also hold in place the button
caps. They just got back to me with a proposition of a “design” they
made from the files I have sent them, where they just took the image
of the outline of the sticker I wanted, and printed it on the sticker
as the image. Of course that is not acceptable, I didn’t want them to
design a sticker based on my graphics, I have sent them an already
designed sticker to make. No response from them yet, but I fear that
if it’s going to be a few weeks for every back-and-forth, it’s going
to be faster to just cut the stickers from a scotch tape myself. So I
did exactly that, and in the process documented how the case is
assembled.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/6359821662235319971.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/6359821662235319971.jpg" />
<p>We are going to be working with transparent surfaces, so I strongly
recommend doing it in a dust-free environment, with the window closed,
away from shedding pets, with freshly washed hands and cleaned tools.
Any specks or hair that get inside the device are going to stay there
and frustrate you forever.</p>
<p>Start by peeling off the paper from the three smaller orange parts
that are going to go on each side of the display.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/2628301662235490967.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/2628301662235490967.jpg" />
<p>Place them on the PCB. I prefer to actually skip the tiny square part
at this point, and add it later, because it’s very easy to drop and
lose it.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/8035521662235558401.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/8035521662235558401.jpg" />
<p>Next, peel the paper from the back side of the front plate, and from
the back sides of the button caps. You can keep the paper on the front
side, and only peel it off at the end, when the device is complete.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/9126661662235702188.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/9126661662235702188.jpg" />
<p>Now place the button caps in the corresponding holes, and secure them
in place with small strips of sticky tape. Make sure to only secure
them on one side, so they can still move. Be careful when placing the
cross button cap, to place it in correct orientation - it’s slightly
wider than its height.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/970111662235857624.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/970111662235857624.jpg" />
<p>Now peel off the protective film from the display. Be careful not to
touch it.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/5707331662235921194.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/5707331662235921194.jpg" />
<p>Place the PCB face-down on the front plate, making sure the two orange
parts are in place and aligned. Put in the first two screws at the
opposite corners.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/5976461662235999719.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/5976461662235999719.jpg" />
<p>Tighten the screws very gently and slowly. They are self-tapping ans
slightly larger than the holes in the front plate, so if you use too
much force, the front plate may crack. Next put in place the small
square part, and tighten the corresponding screw.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/8128251662236109168.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/8128251662236109168.jpg" />
<p>Finish by tightening all the remaining screws. Remember to go slowly
and gently, as to not crack the front plate. They don’t have to be
very tight, just enough to hold the plate in place.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-186921/images/6877171662236191884.jpg" src="projects/project-186921/images/6877171662236191884.jpg" />
<p>Finally, flip the device, and remove the paper from the front and the
buttons. You are done.</p>

<p>The screws on the photos are prototype screws I had at hand. The final
design will use black screws with a smaller and sunken head.</p>
