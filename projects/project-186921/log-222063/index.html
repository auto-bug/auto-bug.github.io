<h1>Jumping Fritzing<a class="headerlink" href="#jumping-fritzing" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2023-08-09 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-186921"><span class="std std-ref">µGame 22</span></a>.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been much activity here, mostly because I didn’t really
know where to take this project. I don’t want it to become my second
job, designing, supporting and selling a shiny product, ready to use
for people who don’t want to contribute anything themselves, but I
don’t really have any better idea about how to get it into the hands
of those who want to be creative with it. So I kinda let it float in
limbo until I figure this out.</p>
<p>The USB-C version worked very well, I’m going to keep that. But I
think there is room for improvement in the power circuit, and the
sound could use some work as well. So those are the things I need to
work on next. I already have an I2S amplifier chip tested in a
different project that I can use here, and I got the MOSFETs for doing
the “ideal diode” circuit, and maybe also for the backlight control.
Maybe I will even use the boost converter chips I got for testing, to
make it run longer on the same batteries.</p>
<p>As for distribution, I have decided to move the design from Fritzing
to EasyEDA, so that you can order the PCB with assembly from JLCPCB
with a single click. Hopefully this will let the people who want it to
get it easily, while freeing me from having to sell it.</p>

<p>So I’m basically re-doing the whole thing in EasyEDA now, also picking
more easily sourced parts as I go. So far I only needed one custom
footprint, for the display itself, but I think I will need to also
modify the button footprint to make the pads a little bit shorter.
Otherwise it’s going well – a few more sleepless nights, and it should
be finished.</p>
<p>Oh, and as a bonus, there is a 3D render!</p>
