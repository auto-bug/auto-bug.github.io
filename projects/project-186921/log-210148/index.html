<h1>First Version<a class="headerlink" href="#first-version" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2022-08-25 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-186921"><span class="std std-ref">µGame 22</span></a>.</p>
<p>I was working on this behind the scenes for a while, mostly because I
didn’t have the energy to write the logs, and because the progress was
really slow. It’s my first time using the RP2040 chip, so I wasn’t
even sure it will work. But I did design the PCB, and when I ran out
of excuses, ordered it together with the laser-cut acrylic parts from <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/879772">&#64;Elecrow</a> .</p>

<p>There isn’t really that much going on here. We have the RP2040 with
all the required caps, resistors, crystals and flash memory, we have a
magnetic speaker with a FET, power switch, seven buttons and a
display. Very basic. Oh, and I used lead-free solder for the first
time. It’s a bit annoying with how it doesn’t melt as well as the
regular one, but it’s not too bad.</p>

<p>The first test of the RP2040 required a few passes with the hot air
gun to get working. You can see I have wrong footprint for the crystal</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>that’s the only kind I could get quickly. Next version will have the
proper footprint. I have to say that having a UF2 bootloader built-in
into the chip is super convenient, no need to flash anything with a
programmer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, I forgot. There was a problem with the speaker. Since I added the
FET at the last moment, I didn’t remove the ground seed from the pad,
and as a result the pad was shorted to the ground. A few deft cuts
fixed this. It will also be fixed in the next version.</p>
