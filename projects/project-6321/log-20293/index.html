<p>Published on 2015-07-01 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-6321"><span class="std std-ref">Katka, a mammalian robot</span></a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday I finally decided to kill one of my failed projects, the
Pico-Kubik (pKubik for short). It was the third robot in the series,
following <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-3300/#project-3300"><span class="std std-ref">µKubik quadruped robot</span></a> . It was supposed to be smaller and cheaper by the virtue of only
using 8 servos, 2 per each leg, and doing inverse kinematics through
solving a complicated set of non-linear equations, for all legs at
once. The idea was that while I can’t position accurately each leg in
3D with only 2 degrees of freedom per leg, I can do it if I use all
the legs together, and ignore the position of the body itself. While I
still think it may be doable, the complexity of required math defeated
me, and the robot was standing there on the shelf, waiting for its
turn.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>So yesterday I decided to disassemble it, and reassemble into a
younger sister of <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-6321"><span class="std std-ref">Katka, a mammalian robot</span></a> . I’ve been complaining that Katka’s leg construction is sub-optimal
and needs rebuilding, but since that requires physical changes, and I
don’t have a version control system for the physical world, I was
reluctant to break an otherwise perfectly fine robot. So now, with 8
spare servos to use, I could just build another Katka from scratch,
but with a different leg configuration.</p>
<p>I also have this idea at the back of my mind, of building a working <a class="reference external" href="https://grabcad.com/library/logicoma-1">Logicoma model</a> , that would look something like this:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/3021291435744764582.png" src="../../../_images/3021291435744764582.png" />
<p>As you can see, this is basically Katka, but with the legs a little
more spread out, and with additional continuous-rotation servos for
the wheels. The angled wheels would let it turn by moving the legs
forward and backward. So, I needed to confirm that this configuration
will indeed walk well, and maybe later add the wheels.</p>
<p>Anyways, here’s the robot walking:</p>

<p>One problem I had is that since the center of mass is much lower in
this one, I needed to tilt the body sideways much further then in
Katka to make sure the center of gravity moves far away from the leg
being raised. I suppose that with the greater leg range that this
configuration gives, I could also move the body forward and backward a
little, to improve that. But generally I’m very happy with how it
works.</p>
