<h1>Sensor and Cable Management<a class="headerlink" href="#sensor-and-cable-management" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2017-05-14 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-19921"><span class="std std-ref">SpiderWing</span></a>.</p>
<p>I’m slowly porting all my robot code to CircuitPython for the little
crab robot, and I got as far as body kinematics before I ran out of
memory on the Feather M0, so next step is some optimizations.</p>
<p>I also decided to put a distance sensor on this little guy, so that it
can react to the environment – since it doesn’t have wireless
connectivity, I can’t make it just a remote controlled drone (and I
don’t want to).</p>
<p>So I finally sat down and ported that Arduino driver for the VL53L0X
sensor to MicroPython. Well, mostly ported – there are still some
parts that I need to implement, but it already does some readings. The
code is at <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-vl53l0x">https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-vl53l0x</a>  but it’s definitely too big to fit on the M0. So I decided to look
for another sensor, preferably with I²C interface, and I found the
SHARP GP2Y0E03 in my drawers – the same sensor that <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-3736/#project-3736"><span class="std std-ref">µBob biped robot</span></a>  uses right now. I quickly wrote a simple driver for CircuitPython for
it – the code is at <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/circuitpython-gp2y0e03/src/tip/gp2y0e03.py">https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/circuitpython-gp2y0e03</a>  – and I attached the sensor to the robot:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-19921/images/9233401494787353422.jpg" src="projects/project-19921/images/9233401494787353422.jpg" />
<p>You can see I also arranged the cables neatly, and added the rubber
socks on the legs.Even though I had a ready library for the sensor, getting it to work
took some time. You see, the PCA9685 chip that I’m using here for
controlling the servos uses two I²C addresses: 0x40 and 0x70 (one for
the individual chip, and one for a roll-call for all chips on the
bus). But the GP2Y0E03 sensor also uses address 0x40 by default. I
could mess with the PCB, solder some wires to the address pins od the
PCA9685 and make it use a different address (I think I will in the
next version of the PCB), but a quicker route was to change the
sensor’s address – you do that by burning e-fuses on it to specify
the new address. The procedure is a bit complex, but there is a ready
Arduino sketch that does it for you, so I gave it a try. Without much
thinking I changed the address to the 0xE0, which was the default in
that sketch.</p>
<p>Wait, aren’t I²C addresses only 7-bit? Where did 0xE0 come from? Well,
that’s the 8-bit notation, including the read/write bit. To get the
7-bit address you need to shift it right by one.</p>
<p>I tested the sensor with the changed address, and it works
beautifully. Now, time to put on the robot and make it do some things.
But wait, it stops working on the robot, just returns 0 all the time.
Wait a moment, what is 0xE0 shifter right by one bit? Isn’t it 0x70,
the other address my servo driver uses? Argh!</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had a second GP2Y0E03 sensor in my stock, so I changed
the address in another one (this time paying more attention) and
everything works perfectly now.</p>
<p>Now I only need to rewrite all this code into as few functions as
possible, to make it all fit in there.</p>
