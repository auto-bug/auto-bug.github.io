<h1>The Way Forward?<a class="headerlink" href="#the-way-forward" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2016-01-29 in <a class="reference internal" href="../project-6050/#project-6050"><span class="std std-ref">Tote</span></a>.</p>
<p>A lot has happened in the recent time for the hobbyist community, and
I’m currently wondering where I want to take this project. Here’s some
random rambling on the subject, just to clear it out of my head.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A Raspberry Pi Zero was released, and it’s small and cheap enough to
fit in Tote and provide some more advanced features, like a Python
interpreter and possibly w WiFi camera. I forked <span class="xref std std-ref">project-9065</span>  to explore that possibility, but it does makes things more
complicated. An operating system, the need to shut it down cleanly,
the need to keep it updated and properly configured, is a pain. Not to
mention the booting time. Powering the Raspberry Pi is also much more
involved than with Arduino – I have to use a 2S battery, which needs
a professional charger with balancing.</p></li>
<li><p>Batteries. While it’s easy to get a LiPo battery from an old cellphone
or similar device, and there are lots of LiPo batteries available in
shops for all those quadcopters, the technology is kinda tricky. They
are not as safe as I would like, and you can damage them by over-
discharging, so I need the voltage monitoring circuitry. Switching to
standard NiCd or NiMH rechargeable AAA batteries seems like a good
alternative. They are much heavier, but Tote can handle that. I will
do some experiments in the near future.</p></li>
<li><p>TV remote. This is the easiest and cheapest way to get remote control,
so that’s why I used it, but now I’m beginning to have my doubts. It
turns Tote into a toy and discourages tinkering. It also requires some
work if you have a different remote than mine – you have to change
all the key codes. And it’s not really that great for precise control.
On the other hand, bluetooth and WiFi both have some great solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>Sensors. This is another thing that keeps Tote in the remote-
controlled toy category. It needs to have more sensors by default. I
have already found switches for the feet, and probably will make that
standard. Unfortunately the popular and cheap distance sensors out
there all require 5V to work properly, and the 3.3V versions are much
more expensive, so I think I can’t have them by default. Same for
inertial sensors – a good module with proper filtering simply costs
too much.</p></li>
<li><p>Micropython. I’ve tried multiple times to make Tote programmable in
Python, and all of them turned to be sub-optimal – either too
expensive or too limiting. But there is a good chance that the ESP8266
port of Micropython will become much more usable, thanks to the
Kickstarter campaign to fund its development. I’m still not sure there
will be enough memory to handle everything I want, but it’s certainly
very exciting for me. Since the ESP8266 only has about 9 usable GPIO
pins on it, and I need to control 12 servos, I would probably still
keep the Arduino and offload the leg inverse kinematics calculations
to it. I’m torn between this and the Pi Zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Force feedback and compliant motion. This is a very interesting topic,
and it makes the robot much more interesting, but with the current
design I simply don’t have enough analog pins, and their precision is
also not so great. Thinking about adding some external ADC modules
over I²C – they are not very expensive. Then I would need to decide
whether to measure the servo position (easy, not that useful) or the
force (hacky, hard, much more interesting).</p></li>
<li><p>Community. Right now I know about about 4 people other than me that
have built a robot more or less inspired by Tote. As far as I know
they do not communicate with each other and do not share experiences
or ideas. I suppose I could do a lot better in this area.</p></li>
<li><p>Open MV. I should get it in a few weeks, and I’m definitely going to
try and put it on Tote or any of my other robots. But it’s too
expensive to be a default.</p></li>
