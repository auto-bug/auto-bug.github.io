<p>The first version of the PCB didn’t work, for the very simple reason that I
inverted the display connector. I did obsess about its orientation a bit,
changing it several times, and finally settled on the one that is wrong. Oh
well. I immediately fixed the design, and also added a power switch that cuts
off the battery connector, because it seems I’m more likely to use this with
a battery.</p>
<p>I worked on other things while waiting for the new PCB, so it wasn’t really
much of a waste of time.</p>
<p>With the connector in the right orientation, the display switched on with some
random pattern of pixels on it. And that’s when I had a second surprise: the
pixels are color. It was supposed to be a LS013B7DH03 display, but apparently I
got LS013B7DH06 instead! Well, I can live with that. They use the same
connector and the same protocol.</p>
<p>I proceeded to try to use that display with CircuitPython. Earlier, I noticed that it already has a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sharpdisplay</span></code> module, so I expected this to be just a
question of using it with the right options. It doesn’t seem to be the case.
There is precious little documentation, but it seems that it was written for some other sharp displays with a different protocol. Oh well, I will just have to write the driver myself.</p>
