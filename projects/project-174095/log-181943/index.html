<h1>Double-function Modifier Keys<a class="headerlink" href="#double-function-modifier-keys" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2020-08-08 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-174095"><span class="std std-ref">Dorsch 40k Keyboard</span></a>.</p>
<p>The feasibility of this keyboard hinges on the ability to use the
modifier keys both as modifier keys and as regular keys. How is this
going to work? The basic idea seems very simple: if you use it with
another key, it’s a modifier, otherwise it’s a regular key. But how
exactly can we tell? There are a lot of details here.</p>
<p>I got the whole idea from the QMK keyboard firmware, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/mod_tap">where this is called Mod-Tap</a> . However, it doesn’t work exactly how I wanted — the difference is in
the time you keep the key pressed. If you press it and release it
quickly (tap), it acts as a regular key, but if you hold it down
longer, it acts as a modifier. This mostly works, except that
sometimes I press a key too slow (especially when it’s a space,
pressed with my thumb), and then there is no visible effect (modifier
keys don’t usually do much on their own) and it seems like the switch
is mechanically failing, which was very frustrating, at least until
you realize what is happening (I replaced the switch before I did).</p>
<p>So I want to do something a little bit smarter:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When you first press a mod key, the fact is recorded, but no keycode
is sent immediately. They keyboard waits to see what happens next.</p></li>
<li><p>If you press any other key (regular or mod key), the recorded mod key
is considered to be a modifier, and the internal status is updated
accordingly.</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as that mod key is released, the status is updated again to
remove the modifier.</p></li>
<li><p>You can chain modifiers like that indefinitely — only the last pressed
mod key needs to be remembered and delayed, as it’s the only one that
can have two functions.</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as you press any regular, single-function key, the last mod
key pressed is considered to be a modifier, and the keycode is sent
immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>If you release a mod key without pressing any other new keys, it is
considered to be a regular key and its keycode is sent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is, in my opinion, a little bit better, because no timings are
involved, so you can do it as fast or as slow as you like. There is
still the downside that you can’t hold down the key to make it repeat
— though I could probably do that with a timeout, or something like a
double-tap. You also can’t send the modifier key alone, so forget
about using the ctrl key for shooting. It should still be easy to
program, and the only extra memory needed is the variable holding the
last pressed key, plus the modifier key status, which now has to be
separate from the actual key status.</p>
