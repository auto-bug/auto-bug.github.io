<p>Published on 2020-09-17 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-174095"><span class="std std-ref">Dorsch 40k Keyboard</span></a>.</p>
<p>After using the keyboard for a few weeks (and getting much better at
touch-typing in the process) I got very much used to it, so I was
hesitating if I should scavenge it and rebuild it with the new PCBs
that just arrived. And if I should, then which one?</p>
<p>In the end I decided to do it, and also to scavenge the <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-167897/#project-167897"><span class="std std-ref">5plit Keyboard Clone</span></a> , so that I can build both versions. The 48-key version went first:</p>

<p>Nothing surprising in here, I just had to edit the layout matrix to
include the two extra columns, and it just works. I’m using it right
now, and it works great for me. It’s definitely a keeper. I didn’t
even need to add a stabilizer under the space. Oh, of course I
reversed the D+ and D- labels for the USB cable, but that’s easily
fixed.</p>
<p>Then I came back to the smaller one, but with LEDs. Turns out that
soldering by hand a string of 40 SMD APA102 LEDs is more work than I
anticipated:</p>

<p>After several hours of looking for shorts, re-soldering, fixing bad
joints and generally having a bad time, I finally got them all to
light up:</p>

<p>And no, I have no idea why the last 6 of them are brighter. Probably a
glitch in the matrix. You get it? Hahahaha. Anyways…</p>
<p>Adding the switches and some transparent key caps was just a
formality:</p>

<p>Right now I left it with the keyboard code, but I’m thinking I could
use it as a macro keyboard instead, with each key just sending a
unique key combination when pressed. And of course with some fancy LED
animations. But that’s just all code.</p>
<p>I was considering putting those PCBs on Tindie as kits, with all the
elements except switches and cable already soldered, but after
debugging the LEDs, I think I will pass on that. I might do it with
the bigger one without the LEDs, though. I wonder if there would be
any interest in that?</p>
