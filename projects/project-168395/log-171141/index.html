<h1>Contest<a class="headerlink" href="#contest" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2019-11-19 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-168395</span>.</p>
<p>So a few words about this project in the context of the contest it was
created for. Sure, the design is very simple, and it wasn’t much work,
but I think it’s a genuinely useful product, especially for beginners.
It lets you experiment with real mechanical keyboard switches (and
some nice blinky lights) without large risk usually involved in making
a large expensive keyboard. It fits several of the contest categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Weirdest Feather — fine, maybe it’s not so weird — not as weird as
the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-19921</span> or the <span class="xref std std-ref">project-168441</span> . But it’s not your usual “sensor breakout” add-on either.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll Cut Yourself On That Edge — it so happens that the Kailh
chocolate switches used in this design are relatively new — I think
the first keyboards using them only appeared a year or two ago, and
they are still a rarity in the mechanical keyboard communities. You
can tell by how hard it is to find key caps for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Retro Feather — what is more retro than a mechanical keyboard? Those
are the kinds of keyboards that were made for computers back when they
costed more than an airplane and had the computing power of a watch.</p></li>
<li><p>Assistive Tech — a dedicated macro keyboard such as can be built with
this is an excellent usability- and accessibility-enhancing tool. But
you don’t have to stop there — experiments with chording, durations,
modes, etc. can lead directly to improvements with our current
keyboards and other input devices. You can also use it as a component
in more complex devices — add an accelerometer and you ave an airmouse
with three buttons.</p></li>
<li><p>Wireless Feather — fine, that’s the second category that doesn’t apply
to this project.</p></li>
</ul>
