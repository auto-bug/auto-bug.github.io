<p>As always, the PCBs arrived from JLCPCB, so I went ahead and assembled
one. I had some fun soldering the accelerometer chip – it’s QFN, but
it was lying in my drawer for a few years, and apparently some of the
pads got oxidized. Only after I went over them with a hot iron and
flux, the soldered correctly. Good thing I decided to test the chip
before I soldered the battery holder, because the chip is underneath
it, and it would be a pain to have to desolder the holder first. Also,
I was afraid that the THT servo sockets will be hard to solder on both
sides of the PCB, but turns out they are far away from each other
enough to not interfere with soldering. Phew. I still don’t think I
could make a fab do this, so if I ever decide to do a workshop with
this robot, I will have to switch to SMD sockets.</p>

<p>After it was all soldered, the UF2 bootloader flashed, and
CircuitPython firmware uploaded, it was time to assemble the legs. And
here’s the first mistake: I made those long slots in the PCB hoping
that I will be able to stuff at least some of the servo cables in
there, to make it look a little cleaner. But I didn’t anticipate how
small this PCB is, and the cables simply don’t fit in there. Oh well.
If I ever make another version, I will remove the slots, leaving only
the parts necessary for servo mounting. That will also make routing of
the traces easier.</p>

<p>With the legs connected, the servos zeroed and the initial leg
positions calibrated, I copied some of the old code for walking (the
SAMD21 build of CircuitPython doesn’t include async functionality that
my newer code uses), and it walks. I just had to change the order in
which the legs are initialized, so the right timers get assigned to
their PWMs. However, I found further mistakes.</p>
<p>First of all, the switch that switches between walking and battery
charging is reversed, so the labels are wrong. Not such a big deal, I
suppose, and I could easily enough fix it by swapping the labels.</p>
<p>I also thought that I made a second mistake, connecting the USB power
so that it powered the servos, but that was just a mistake in
soldering the shottky diode in reverse. After flipping it, the servos
are now correctly only powered from the battery, so I can program the
robot when it’s switched to charging mode, without worrying about it
making random movements.</p>
<p>The next steps now may involve using the accelerometer for interesting
things, doing something about the cables (I need to open one servo and
see if I can easily shorten the cable from that side), and seeing if I
can enable async on this build, possibly at the cost of disabling some
of the built-in modules that I’m not using.</p>
