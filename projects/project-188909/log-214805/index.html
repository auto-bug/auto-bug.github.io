<p>Published on 2022-12-31 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-188909"><span class="std std-ref">Wee Bug</span></a>.</p>
<p>I measured the servos, and quickly designed a PCB similar to the one
used in <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-180025/#project-180025"><span class="std std-ref">Fluffbug</span></a> , but proportionally smaller.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-188909/images/91721672442475030.png" src="projects/project-188909/images/91721672442475030.png" />
<p>I gave up on the IDC connectors for the servos, and just went with the
1.25mm JST sockets. Instead of the Lolin S2 Mini, I decided to use
either the Adafruit Qt Py board, or Seeedstudio Xiao – as it happens,
they have the same pinouts, so I can decide later, or even switch
between them. All the rest is pretty much the same as in Fluffbug, but
since there was some free space, I also added a footprint for an
optional infrared sensor, so that I can use a tv remote to control the
robot.</p>
<p>The last problem is the battery. I didn’t want to use the pouch lipo
batteries, because they are not standard and pretty dangerous, so I
looked at what standard battery size would fit it. Eventually, I
decided on LIR2450 (or the bigger LIR2477 version), and added a coin
cell battery holder to the PCB. The contacts stick out a bit, but I
can just cut them.</p>

<p>Of course as my luck has it, as soon as I ordered the PCBs, I found
out the perfect battery size that would make it look exactly as
Fluffbug, only smaller: the 14250 cells. There is even a holder for it
that looks identical to the one in Fluffbug, just smaller:</p>

<p>Just look at how cute it is! In the end, I decided to order some of
those cells and holders as well, and I will try to bodge them on the
PCB somehow.\</p>
