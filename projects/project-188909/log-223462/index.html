<h1>A String of Prototypes<a class="headerlink" href="#a-string-of-prototypes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2023-09-20 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-188909"><span class="std std-ref">Wee Bug</span></a>.</p>
<p>The first Weebug was just a quick hack to see if it will work. It
turned out to work even better than Fluffbug, so I made a second one,
this time trying to make it look cool, and cleaning up the design. But
if I want to do workshops with this eventually, I need to make it
easily manufacturable and as easy to assemble as possible. So I made
another prototype, with the same PCB art, but with an RP2040 chip
instead of the unobtainium SAMD21.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/1300041695228008871.jpg" src="../../../_images/1300041695228008871.jpg" />
<p>That was also a test for the JLCPCB assembly services, a test of the
new leg design, and a test of the 1mm servo plugs, that are physically
much smaller than the 1.2mm ones, at least in the SMD version. The
results are… mixed. The assembly service works as advertised and is
very nice, but now I have five assembled boards I paid for that I have
no use for – I will explain why shortly. I also had to pay the customs
duty on the package, because with shipping it went over the threshold,
so it got more expensive than I anticipated. I think that in the
future I will prefer assembling the prototypes by hand myself, even if
that means I have to make a separate order at LCSC for the parts.</p>
<p>What didn’t work so great are the servo sockets, and that’s mostly
because of my own mistakes. First of all, I placed them too close to
the servo mounting holes. There is enough clearance for the servos
themselves, but not for the head of the screw that holds them in
place. I had to break out my hot air gun and move the sockets slightly
in on their footprints to make everything fit. Of course I can’t
expect anyone else building the robot to do that, so I can’t give out
or sell those boards. The second mistake is even more stupid. I
swapped the signal and ground pins on the sockets. I was able to test
the robot by carefully swapping those wires on the servos (the
contacts in the plug are easy to remove and swap), but again, I can’t
expect anyone else to do that.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/6458151695228490935.jpg" src="../../../_images/6458151695228490935.jpg" />
<p>And of course there is still the continuing problem of cable
management, for which the only solution I found so far is to open each
servo, desolder the wires, cut them to the right size from that side,
and solder them back and reassemble each servo. The result is very
clean and aesthetically pleasing, but it’s a bit too much fiddly work
for a workshop, and I can’t do it for every servo in every kit.</p>
<p>So that’s a partial success. I definitely learned a lot, but there is
some unnecessary waste in there…</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/83481695228668165.jpg" src="../../../_images/83481695228668165.jpg" />
<p>I also decided that putting a bare chip on my boards doesn’t always
make sense. It’s great when I need a lot of GPIOs, for example for a
display or camera, but otherwise using a development board is both
less work, and, in at least in case of the rp2040 and esp32 boards,
cheaper – when I’m not assembling them myself, anyways.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I got my hands on the Seeedstudio Xiao ESP32-S3
Sense devboard, and I was greatly impressed. Not only is it blazing
fast and has loads of memory and flash, but it even comes with a tiny
little camera and microphone module, perfect for a robot like this.
And it’s still in the Xiao form factor. So I made another prototype,
this time specifically for this Xiao board:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/1202191695229554046.jpg" src="../../../_images/1202191695229554046.jpg" />
<p>It even includes battery recharging chip, though to use it you have to
solder to some pads on the back of the board. That is what pushed me
towards soldering the Xiao board directly to the PCB instead of using
a socket. In hindsight, I think it was a mistake. For convenience, I
made through-hole contacts on the back where those pads are, so they
are easy to solder this way, but it would be much nicer to have the
devboard removable. Oh, and I got the servo sockets right this time:
the signals are correct, and I moved them out of the way of the
screws. I had to move some electronic components under the battery
holder, which made it later very annoying to debug my battery
problems, but oh well.</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/8561061695229774164.jpg" src="../../../_images/8561061695229774164.jpg" />
<p>But I didn’t avoid mistakes completely this time either. The DW07D
chip I use for protecting the battery didn’t work correctly this time,
even though it worked in all the previous prototypes, and several
other projects. The only change I made is to connect the resistor that
goes to the positive contact of the battery after the power switch,
not before it as before – I was hoping it would make the discharge of
battery left in the device slower when it’s switched off. But for some
reason that made the chip panic and cut the battery off. Strange, but
a quick bodge wire to move the resistor before the switch fixed it.</p>
<p>I’m also not the fan of the external antenna, which it a bit to large
to attach anywhere on the robot.</p>
<p>So I got that one assembled and working, and I immediately started
thinking about the improvements I want. I could use the bigger
batteries, the same ones as in Fluffbug, for much longer battery life.
That would also give me more space for the antenna. I want to make the
microcontroller board pluggable, so I can program it independently, or
have multiple ones with different programs and possibly different
sensors. So I need a socket for it. And I think I would give up on the
on-board battery charging chip of the Xiao, because the other Xiaos
don’t have it, and because it wouldn’t let me recharge the battery
with the power for the servos switched off. Battery charging chips are
not expensive, I can just add my own in there. And finally, if I move
all the components to the front, I won’t need to put them under the
battery anymore, and there is plenty of space for the servo sockets.
And I can stuff the loose servo cables under the microcontroller
board, which is not perfect, but is some kind of a solution for the
cable problem.</p>
<p>So I came up with this:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/6843111695230451345.png" src="../../../_images/6843111695230451345.png" />
<p>That includes all the ideas I had so far. I’m sure I will have more
once this one arrives, but hopefully they won’t be important enough
for another prototype. I think this is the final design, or at least
very close to it.</p>
