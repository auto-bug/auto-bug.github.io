<p>I like the tiny robot very much, but I didn’t publish the design files
for it, because the Hobby King servos I used for it are discontinued
and you can’t buy them anymore. But then I went to Aliexpress and
searched for 2g sub-micro servos, and lo and behold, there is a whole
bunch of them out there. They don’t have a model number – all they
tell you is that they have POM gears and 260° range of motion. And one
of three kinds of plugs to choose from. They are slightly more
expensive than your regular 9g servos, at about $2, but still very
cheap. So I decided to go ahead and try to make another WeeBug with
them.</p>

<p>Oh, right, and they are black instead of white. So I got purple leg
pieces this time around. I also used a slightly different battery
holder, but it didn’t require any modifications.</p>
<p>Now how do the new servos work?</p>
<p>Wow, they are fast! Much faster than the white ones. During
calibration I had the robot literally jumping on the table when the
legs adjusted their positions. I think I will be able to make this one
scuttle around much faster than the white one.</p>

<p>Other than the speed, I don’t really see much difference. They have
enough torque, and I’m only using the standard 180° range of motion
anyways. There is no noticeable jitter or other problems.\</p>
<p>One difference is that those servos don’t come with mounting screws,
so you will need some screws of your own to attach the servos to the
leg pieces. I also made the holes in the leg pieces too small, so some
rimming/dremelling was necessary to make the servo horns and the
screws fit correctly.</p>
<p>I will be fixing those mistakes, and then I will publish the design
files.</p>
