<h1>The Eye<a class="headerlink" href="#the-eye" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2015-08-29 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-7168"><span class="std std-ref">Logicoma-kun</span></a>.</p>
<p>I still don’t have a nice solution for the hands, but I’m leaving that
for later. Today I decided to work on the eye.</p>
<p>As I probably mentioned before, I plan to put a distance sensor inside
that rotating eye. That means I need a distance sensor that is small
enough. Fortunately, I have bought several of those <a class="reference external" href="http://hackaday.com/2015/02/18/new-part-day-time-of-flight-sensors/">time-of-flight sensors that were described on Hackaday some time ago</a> , so I decided to use those. Some time ago I made breakout boards for
them, so it was time to actually cut them out and try the thing.</p>
<p>Turns out that soldering QFN packages with a soldering iron, and with
the pads not sticking out even a tiny bit, is practically impossible.
But I remembered that in the FabLab nearby they had a hot air gun.
That should do it nicely.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>A quick test with Arduino Nano and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ToF_Range_Finder-VL6180_Arduino_Library/tree/V_1.1.0">Sparkfun’s library demo</a>  confirmed that I indeed have a properly soldered sensor in there. By
the way, why didn’t I just buy one of the breakout boards from
Sparkfun, or cheaper, Aliexpress? Because they are huge! I made my
board square, put the sensor right in the middle, and put all the
discrete components on the other side, to minimize space used.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-7168/images/769711440868673206.jpg" src="projects/project-7168/images/769711440868673206.jpg" />
<p>This way I can fit that sensor in tight places, such as the eye of
this robot. A little bit of hot glue, some dremeling to make a hole,<em>et voila:</em></p>
<img alt="projects/project-7168/images/949341440868868384.jpg" src="projects/project-7168/images/949341440868868384.jpg" />
<p>Now, I had to make that hole, and I had to make it bigger than I
wanted. Initially I planned to only make a tiny hole or two for the
lenses of the sensor (it’s infra-red, so that transparent acrylic is
more like a mirror to it, than transparent), but turns out that it
gave wrong readings until I enlarged the hole to this size. Oh well.</p>
<p>Next, I cut out the “ears” from a servo, and glued that inside the
ball (the rubber band just holds it in place until the glue catches).</p>
<img alt="projects/project-7168/images/7049581440869160574.jpg" src="projects/project-7168/images/7049581440869160574.jpg" />
<p>Then just install it in place.</p>

<p>I might add the second half of the ball (with a hole for the servo cut
out in it), to increase the angle at which the eye can rotate, but for
now I’m pretty happy with the result. It could be better, but it could
also be a lot worse.</p>
