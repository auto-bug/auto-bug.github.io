<p>Published on 2022-08-28 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-182342"><span class="std std-ref">Camera Shield for S2 Mini</span></a>.</p>
<p>I still didn’t get any useful results with this shield. I put it away
for a while, but recently the camera support for CircuitPython was
rewritten, so I though I will try again. All I managed to get is some
damaged JPEG frames:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-182342/images/6166091661637448706.jpg" src="projects/project-182342/images/6166091661637448706.jpg" />
<p>But that suggests, that indeed both the hardware and software do work
and all the connections are correct, there is just a problem with
reliability. So maybe some of those capacitors, resistors and
inductors that are on those example schematics, that I completely
ignored while designing my shield are actually necessary?</p>
<img alt="projects/project-182342/images/9844311661637652787.png" src="projects/project-182342/images/9844311661637652787.png" />
<p>You can see there are quite a lot of them, and I reduced it all to
just two, because I didn’t want to feed the Big Capacitor consortium
that puts all those unnecessary capacitors on the schematics. Well,
easy enough to test, what if I put back some additional caps and see
if that affects the reliability?</p>
<img alt="projects/project-182342/images/9354201661637775325.jpg" src="projects/project-182342/images/9354201661637775325.jpg" />
<p>By the way, someone should really start to produce parts that contain
several capacitors in parallel inside them, so that you don’t have to
do things like this. Anyways, I added two 220nF caps to those 1µF caps
I already had there, to see if it would change anything. And yes, it
does! Now my code crashes into a hard fault handler instead of
outputting corrupted JPEGs unreliably. Which seems like a worse
outcome, but the important part is that there indeed was a change, so
the filtering actually has an observable effect.</p>
<p>So the next step is to redesign this camera shield with the full
complement of capacitors and other filtering paraphernalia, and see if
that works. If it does, <em>then</em> I can see if some of them can be
removed.</p>
