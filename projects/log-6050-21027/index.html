<h1>Cheap Chinese STM32 Boards<a class="headerlink" href="#cheap-chinese-stm32-boards" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2015-07-16.</p>
<p>We already saw that Tote can work with a Pro Mini, Pro Micro or Teensy
3.1 as its brains. The Teensy is especially interesting, as it gives
us a lot of pins for additional sensors and effectors. But it’s quite
expensive. Could we maybe use a cheaper ARM board instead?</p>
<p>Turns out we can. Digging through my parts box, I found a “blue pill”
board that I ordered some time ago from China for $4. It’s an STM32
Cortex-m3 microcontroller on a relatively small development board. A
little bigger than Teensy, but still compatible with the 600mil DIM
sockets, so the same as the Pro Minis and Teensy. Of course, the
pinout is not compatible, so I would need to make a custom board, or
do the same trick I did with Teensy – use wires to connect to the
right pins.</p>

<p>But how do I program it? Do I need a JTAG programmer, a complex setup
for cross-compiling to ARM and a complicated GDB configuration? Turns
out that I don’t, because there is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stm32duino.com/">stm32duino</a>  project! And they even have a step-by-step YouTube video on how to
program that board:</p>
<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="None" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ze6q6NidS5w"></iframe>
<p>Turns out it’s very simple and works like a charm. They also have the
pinout of that board <a class="reference external" href="http://www.stm32duino.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=117">on their forum</a> :</p>
<img alt="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1925191437063394286.png" src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1925191437063394286.png" />
<p>That should make it all much easier. Unfortunately, that pinout
doesn’t say which pins support PWM and thus are suitable for use with
the Servo library. I had to get them by trial and error, which is what
I spent the bulk of my time on. But ultimately I came up with a
working set of pins, which I put in the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/commits/162ec23c4fbeadc1ddd0feea622ca22ff2a53662">servo.ino</a>  of the code that worked for Teensy 3.1. And it works. I will skip the
video this time, because it looks exactly the same as the one with
Teensy, so you can go and watch that one instead.</p>
