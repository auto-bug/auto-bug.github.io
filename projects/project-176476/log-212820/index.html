<p>Published on 2022-10-23 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-176476"><span class="std std-ref">Electronic 6-hole Ocarina</span></a>.</p>
<p>It has been some time since I last worked on this project, mostly
because the tests now require actually playing some sounds, and that
generally annoys people. But I have been home alone this past week, so
I managed to push this a little bit forward. First of all, I had to
figure out how the holes actually work. So I took the fingering chart,
noted the frequencies of the notes, and compared how covering and
uncovering of each hole affected the frequency.</p>
<img alt="projects/project-176476/images/9100031666560530162.jpg" src="projects/project-176476/images/9100031666560530162.jpg" />
<p>Turns out the frequency is roughly linear to the total surface area of
the holes (as helpfully stated by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vessel_flute#Pitch_and_fingering">this Wikipedia article</a> ), but not quite, as it also depends on the total volume of air and
other details. Also, most ocarinas are not really tuned according to
equally tempered scale, which is why makes them so interesting — each
one has its own unique feel.</p>
<p>So I decided to just go with very rough increments of frequency by
200, 150, 100 and 50 Hz respectively for each of the four holes on the
front (ignoring the holes on the back for now), and later I might just
“snap” them to the nearest clear note, if that’s needed.</p>
<p>Immediately I discovered several problems with the current prototype.
Since the traces for the touch pads pass under the speaker, and they
are pretty sensitive, the speaker interferes with the touch sensing,
giving a weird vibratto effect. Also, the traces for different pads
are too close to each other, and it’s very easy to touch ones you
didn’t mean to touch. And finally, the speaker was very quiet.</p>
<p>I solved the first and last problem by removing the speaker from the
PCB, adding a MOSFET, and making the speaker hang from some wires.
Unfortunately the second problem will require a PCB redesign, and I
decided to also add a battery holder, so that it can be used without a
computer.</p>
<p>I still have one more problem, which is a little bit weird, that I so
far failed to diagnose properly. It seems that removing a finger from
the pad is detected with some noticeable delay. I’m not entirely sure
where that comes from, so I’m holding off on ordering a new PCB yet,
in case the fix involves moving the traces again.</p>
