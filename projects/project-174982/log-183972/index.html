<h1>Goodbye Flounder, Hello Turbot<a class="headerlink" href="#goodbye-flounder-hello-turbot" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2020-09-23 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-174982"><span class="std std-ref">Turbot Keyboard</span></a>.</p>
<p>I’m still on my keyboard roll, with two more keyboard-related
projects. This one is going to be a scavenging on a very successful
educationally, but not so much in terms of the end product, project — <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-167912/#project-167912"><span class="std std-ref">Flounder Keyboard</span></a> . That keyboard is indeed really flat, as intended, but due to me
messing around with key spacing and due to poor switches — not very
usable. It would be a shame to have all those switches just lying
there and gathering dust, though, so I decided to rebuild it into a
keyboard with a slightly more interesting layout (and proper key
spacing this time).</p>
<p>I have recently built a bunch of tiny ortholinear keyboards, and
discovered that touch-typing is actually much easier if the columns
are not all jumbled and skewed. In fact, I’m using one of those
keyboards, <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-174917/#project-174917"><span class="std std-ref">Dorsch 48k Keyboard</span></a> , as my main keyboard every day now. It’s great, because there is
simply not enough room to move your hands away from the home row, so
you are touch-typing whether you like it or not. However, there are
some small inconveniences still, namely having to keep your hands
relatively close together, and one-handed operation being a bit more
involved, especially when playing computer games and needing access to
the number row.</p>
<p>The first problem has a standard solution: split keyboard. However,
from my experiments with <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-167897/#project-167897"><span class="std std-ref">5plit Keyboard Clone</span></a> I know that when the keyboard consists of two pieces, each of them
tend to wander around my desk randomly, ending up in weird positions.
It also gets trickier to locate the keyboard after taking my hand from
the mouse. So I really wanted a single-piece device this time. But no
problem, instead of splitting the keys into two separate keyboards, we
can put them all on one keyboard, but in two groups that are tilted
and moved apart a little. We get our standard ergonomic keyboard that
way. So that’s what I want to build. But which layout?</p>
<p>I immediately noticed that I haven’t heard about a low-profile Atreus
keyboard, even though there is a perfect name for such a contraption:
Flatreus. So I started with an Atreus layout, but then having all
those extra switches and caps from Flounder, I thought that it would
be a waste not to use them all too. So I designed a layout that is
basically a regular keyboard, with the middle replace with an Atreus-
like arrangement:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/8787051600887917413.png" src="../../../_images/8787051600887917413.png" />
<p>I liked the general feel of this, and also the symmetry this design
has, but one thing that immediately jumps out at you are the gaps
between the slanted and the straight portions. So I tried to smush
them together a bit better:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/858691600888038182.png" src="../../../_images/858691600888038182.png" />
<p>Then I though: why not make the transition a little bit more smooth,
like the Alice or Saggitarious layouts, only ortholinear? You know, a
bit like those X-Bow keyboards that <a class="reference external" href="http://Hackaday.com">Hackaday.com</a>  wrote about a while ago. Something like this:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/2736771600888202731.png" src="../../../_images/2736771600888202731.png" />
<p>I really liked this design, a decided that this is going to be
keyboard I’m going to make. But looks is one thing, and actual
usability another, so I went back and added the curve known from
Atreus that takes into account the fact that our fingers tend to be
different lengths. I ended up with the final layout:</p>
<img alt="../../../_images/6791631600888347726.png" src="../../../_images/6791631600888347726.png" />
<p>This is what I’m going to make.</p>
