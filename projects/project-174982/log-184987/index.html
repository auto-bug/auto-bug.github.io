<h1>One More Try<a class="headerlink" href="#one-more-try" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2020-10-13 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-174982</span>.</p>
<p>This project has been a bit unlucky from the beginning. Not only it is
a continuation of a failed project, which brought its own problems,
but I’ve been really sloppy with the execution as well. I decided to
get mu stuff together a little bit more and give this layout a fair
chance this time. So I’m going to make this keyboard, at a proper
scale and with known good switches. It will be 2mm higher because of
that, but it will be comfortable.</p>
<p>This keyboard is driven by three main goals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a reasonably complete keyboard with digits and arrows that is low-
profile,</p></li>
<li><p>with an ergonomic, one-piece split layout,</p></li>
<li><p>ortholinear.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This project was most inspired with something called the TGR Alice
keyboard, designed by Yuk Tsi:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-174982/images/723351602617205799.jpg" src="projects/project-174982/images/723351602617205799.jpg" />
<p>There is simply something very elegant in the way he compromised
between the available keycaps, the traditional layout, and the needs
of ergonomy. I love how this looks, however, I learned that layouts
with staggered rows like this make it harder for me to touch-type. I
want an ortholinear layout, where the keys are arranged in a grid, or
at least into columns for each of the fingers. The original Turbot
layout was an attempt to create something like that, mostly based on
the Atreus layout and some other ergonomic keyboards, trying to make
the gaps between keys manageable by angling each column at a different
angle. But if you look carefully at that Alice keyboard, that is not
what they did there. Instead, you have three sections of the keyboard,
each angled differently, but otherwise following the traditional
layout.</p>
<p>So what if I took an ortholinear keyboard instead, but then repeated
the operations they did with Alice on that? I came up with something
like this:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-174982/images/7548101602617589288.png" src="projects/project-174982/images/7548101602617589288.png" />
<p>It’s a little busier than Alice, mostly because there are more keys on
the bottom row, and because the grids of the ortholinear parts are
very strong visual cues, so it is not as elegant, but it should be
equally or even more convenient. This time I didn’t stagger the
columns—except for the ones for the little fingers, which are
naturally about half a key lower, due to the angling. That should work
well with the fact that the little finger is shorter in most people.</p>
<p>I also removed some of the extra keys Turbot originally had on the
sides—since I need a “function” key anyways for Fn keys, I can as well
put them on a separate layer, together with all the media keys and
such. Thanks to that the PCB also has a much more “normal” shape:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-174982/images/6515131602618201989.png" src="projects/project-174982/images/6515131602618201989.png" />
<img alt="projects/project-174982/images/495111602618211309.png" src="projects/project-174982/images/495111602618211309.png" />
<p>You can tell that I didn’t really take my time to route the traces
nicely and make them all bend at 45° angle, as they should. The reason
is that with the modern fabrication methods it doesn’t really matter,
and I was in a hurry to add this PCB to an already ongoing order at
JLCPCB, so that they can be shipped together. You see, they let you do
that, and since there was a National day, my order didn’t ship yet, so
I used the chance.</p>
<p>I have now made a version of that PCB with nicer traces and with some
holes for mounting stabilizers, I will make it available if this PCB
works.</p>
<p>I still had some free pins, so I added a single LED and a joystick,
with some extra keys in the middle — maybe I will make it emulate
mouse too, we will see. In the worst case I will leave those
unpopulated.</p>
<p>Note about key caps: I am going to use the same key caps I initially
got for Flounder, and they are a bit of a strange set. This layout is
designed specially for those key caps. All keys are either 1U, 1.5U or
2U, except for the Ctrl keys, which for some reason are 1.25U. More
common key caps usually have more of the .25U keys, since the two
bottom alphanumeric rows are staggered by 0.25U, but not on the
keyboard those key caps were made for. I have no idea why they did
that. The short version is, that if you plan to use any key caps from
a normal keyboard, you will have to modify this design somewhat.</p>
<p>Then, since I’m waiting for the PCB anyways, I also took some time one
evening to think about the precise location of the keys on the other
layer. I came up with something like this:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-174982/images/5913311602618854663.png" src="projects/project-174982/images/5913311602618854663.png" />
<p>I might still move the arrow cluster on the left hand side, to make it
a more standard WASD, but I’m not sure.</p>
