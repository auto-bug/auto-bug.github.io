<h1>Why Separate Button Controller?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-separate-button-controller" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Published on 2018-01-18 in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-27757</span>.</p>
<p>I have been asked why I’m using a separate chip for handling the
buttons, so I thought I will just explain it in here. The question was
why not just use the edge connector, and then use the additional pins
available on the Micro:bit for reading the buttons. There are actually
to reasons for that:</p>
<section id="i-don-t-like-the-edge-connector">
<h2>I don’t like the edge connector.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-don-t-like-the-edge-connector" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ever since I first saw it, I tried to work around it with something
smaller, lighter and less expensive — you can look at my <span class="xref std std-ref">project-9685</span> — but I never managed to get a reliable connection without damaging
the Micro:bit itself. I do have a bunch of those connectors, both
soldered on a breakout board, and loose, but they are simply too large
for such a small handheld device, I don’t have a Fritzing footprint
for them (and don’t feel like making one), and soldering all the pins
is a chore. Bolts are, on the other hand, a tested and reliable
alternative.</p>

<section id="handling-buttons-is-not-trivial">
<h2>Handling buttons is not trivial.<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-buttons-is-not-trivial" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Looking at the code for the button controller you wouldn’t guess that,
but handling the button presses properly is actually a non-trivial
task. You have to de-bounce them, and you have to buffer them — those
are some simple things we came to expect from anything with buttons,
because it’s so common. Doing that in the limited version of
Micropython that runs on the Micro:bit, without access to timers or
interrupts, while at the same time handling the logic of whatever game
you are playing would be a challenge, if not outright impossible.
Doing it in C as a built-in module would be a little easier (that’s
how I did it for <span class="xref std std-ref">project-27629</span> ), but getting that extra code merged and released would take ages —
the current release is a year behind, and there is never enough
memory, so I don’t think they would happily accept an extra module
that is only useful in one project. Having to use a custom Micropython
firmware would make it impossible to code using Mu or any of the other
dedicated editors.</p>
<p>So considering all that, I decided to use a dedicated chip for the
buttons. I initially started with a simple gpio expander chip, like in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-19371</span> , but that still requires you to poll it constantly and do the de-
bouncing and buffering yourself. You can also easily miss presses.
Then I switched to the HT16K33 that I’m using in <span class="xref std std-ref">project-21578</span> , because it does the de-bouncing and buffering for you, but that’s an
expensive and bulky chip, that we are not really fully utilizing. So I
looked for the cheapest microcontroller with enough pins, and ATtiny24
seems like the perfect fit, especially since I already have experience
with AVR.</p>
