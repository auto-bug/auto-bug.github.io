<p>When I just started with the Stage library, I used BMP files for the
graphics, mostly because they were uncompressed, so it seemed the
easiest way. And it was good enough for a prototype, to confirm this
is possible. But there are a lot of problems with BMP files, starting
with their size, end ending with the fact that there isn’t really any
official spec of them, and they have a lot of incompatible variants
and versions. So while my code worked fine with images saved with
GIMP, it didn’t with those created with other programs. And honestly,
forcing people to use GIMP is just too cruel.</p>
<p>So for easier use, I decided to add GIF support. I took some work, as
the compression algorithm is pretty tricky, but I got it done in pure
Python, and with some restrictions, included it in the Stage library.
GIF files are pretty much the same no matter what saves them, so that
makes things a little bit easier for everyone. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I looked at how people try to use this library at
the recent EuroPython conference, I had to revise my conclusions. You
see, for most people GIF is animated format. That means that most
sprite-making software, when asked to save as GIF, will create an
animation of your sprite’s frames, instead of an atlas. And that is
very much not what Stage expects. The fact that you need to have at
most 16 colors is also a problem, as many programs will happily add
colors to your palette while handling or converting your GIFs,
resulting in files that used to work stopping working when you edit
them.</p>
<p>So what format should I be using? PNG is the most popular format for
static pixel-art in the community, and most tools support exporting
atlases of frames to that format. It’s also pretty well specified, so
all the tools generate the same format. But the compression algorithm
for PNG is even more complicated than for GIF, so what can I do? Turns
out that the compression algorithm used by PNG, zlib deflate, is
actually built-in into Python! And CircuitPython has an efficient C
implementation of it available as a module too! So I don’t have to
worry about the compression at all, I just need to handle the file
structure, which is even simpler than in GIF.</p>
<p>So today I sat down, read the PNG specification, and wrote the ~50
lines of code needed to load the images. And it works! I even managed
to fit the extra code and the zlib module on the PewPew M4 boards (I
just had to nudge a bit the Japanese translation). Once the pull
request merges, we will be able to use PNG images, and I will try to
write a detailed tutorial.</p>
<p>Update: I had to remove the GIF support after all, to make room.</p>
