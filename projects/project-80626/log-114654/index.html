<p>Published on 2018-03-11 in <a class="reference internal" href="../#project-80626"><span class="std std-ref">Stage, a Tile and Sprite Engine</span></a>.</p>
<p>One of the nicer MicroPython-capable boards with integrated color
display out there is the M5Stack. It’s a bit pricey, but you get a
really nice enclosure, and if you get the “faces” thing, even several
keyboards. So I decided to try porting the Stage library to it first.
After a day of work, mostly spent writing the driver for the ILI9341
display, I ended up with something like this:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-80626/images/2263441520724593878.jpg" src="projects/project-80626/images/2263441520724593878.jpg" />
<p>The small square area is the 128×128 pixels for which the library was
originally written. Of course with a bigger screen you can make games
that use a larger area. But the rendering doesn’t look quite right.
After half a day of debugging, I considerably simplified the driver,
but I didn’t solve the issue until I tried to reduce the speed of the
SPI clock down to 40MHz. I have forgotten that ESP32 has really fast
SPI, which apparently this display can’t handle reliably. With that, I
have proper rendering:</p>
<img alt="projects/project-80626/images/95211520724881062.jpg" src="projects/project-80626/images/95211520724881062.jpg" />
<p>Now, the buttons. The keyboard attachments all use an ATmega328p chip
working as an I2C slave on address 0x08 and reporting the pressed keys
as a simple bit mask — pretty much like <a class="reference internal" href="../../project-19371/#project-19371"><span class="std std-ref">D1 Mini X-Pad Shield</span></a> or <span class="xref std std-ref">project-26823</span> . That’s a problem, because I have to poll the bus, and if I do it
only once a frame, I might lose keypresses. For now I used the naive
code that just returns the current state of the buttons. I will need
to see if I can use a timer to have a proper button handling, with a
buffer and all that.</p>
<p>I also didn’t explore the sound yet. The ESP32 has a DAC, and the
M5Stack has an amplifier and a speaker — you can tell, because you can
hear every single GPIO toggle in that thing. But there is no ready-to-
use functionality in MicroPython to simply play WAV files in the
background, like there is in CircuitPython, so I might need to do some
work there.</p>
