# Analog PCBs
Published on 2019-02-07 in {ref}`project-19371`.

The PCBs for the analog joysticks arrived while I was away, and they
look good so far:

I will probably need to add some kapton tape on the metal back of the
joysticks, so that they don't short the vias/buttons, but that's just
a detail (and I could do tented vias anyways, was just too lazy).

Next step is assembling this and modifying the firmware for the
attiny24.
