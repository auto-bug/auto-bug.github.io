# New Version Assembled
Published on 2017-09-07 in {ref}`project-19371`.

It took me a while to assemble this, because by mistake I used 4x4mm
button footprints instead of the 5x5mm, so I had to order matching
switches. But it's there, and it's working. Here's a comparison photo
with the old version:

The friction-fit alternating pins work really well, and make the whole
thing much smaller. The chip, even though SMD, is still pretty huge —
I'd love to find a small, preferably QFN, chip that can handle buttons
over I²C, but I'm too lazy to look for it specially. The buttons are
much more convenient than the old "joystick", even though they are
still not very friendly to your fingertips.
