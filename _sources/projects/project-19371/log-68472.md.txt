# Buy it on Tindie
Published on 2017-10-09 in {ref}`project-19371`.

I have added this to my shop at Tindie, so you can now buy it: [https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/x-pad-20-buttons-shield-
for-d1-mini/](https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/x-pad-20-buttons-shield-for-d1-mini/) 

It's the cheapest shield I have made so far. I am not entirely happy
with it yet (the buttons are too small and I should have put the chip
on the underside), but it's actually very useful, so why not let
people get it. It goes well together with the official OLED shield:
