# Proper Buttons
Published on 2017-02-25 in {ref}`project-19371`.

The first prototype used whatever buttons I have at hand at the moment
â€” they weren't very good. Now the buttons I ordered for it arrived, so
I assembled a second prototype. Unfortunately, the buttons I ordered
are too big, so I had to wrap their legs under them. But it works and
doesn't look too bad.
