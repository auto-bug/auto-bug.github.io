# Done.
Published on 2017-01-25 in {ref}`project-19371`.

The PCB arrived from OSHPark, and it works. You can order it at: [https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/J8a9MVbO](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/J8a9MVbO) 

I'm not happy with the buttons -- I used some cheap SMD buttons that I
had on hand, but they are not really designed for being pushed
directly by fingers. I might try gluing something on top of them, so
they work better.

I used a chip socket for the chip, and the whole thing is rather high.
In the future, I would probably use a different chip, in SMD version,
and maybe even put it on the bottom.

All in all, it works well enough and I'm quite happy with it.
