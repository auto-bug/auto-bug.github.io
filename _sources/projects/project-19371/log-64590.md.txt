# Upgrade
Published on 2017-08-03 in {ref}`project-19371`.

I went ahead and upgraded the design of this shield a little bit. It
now uses all SMD components (including the PCA8574 chip), has all
parts on one side, and uses buttons in place of that tiny joystick
thing. Oh, and I dropped the address selection jumpers, since you are
not going to have more than one of this on a single dev board anyways.

:::
The pin headers now are staggered for a pressure fit, so that you
should be able to put this between your dev board and a display shield
without additional headers increasing the height.
