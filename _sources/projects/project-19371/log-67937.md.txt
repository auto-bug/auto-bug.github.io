# Pull-ups? We need no @#$@$ pull-ups!
Published on 2017-09-28 in {ref}`project-19371`.

Turns out that I have over-engineered this shield a little bit — I
wanted to make sure the pins are pulled up when the buttons are not
pressed, so I added a pull-up resistor to each button. But looking at
the {ref}`project-26823` project, I noticed that [@davedarko ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459) didn't use any pull-ups, and it works reliably for him. We dived into
the datasheet a bit and did some experiments, and it turns out you
really don't need them. So now I'm leaving the pads for the pull-up
resistors un-populated. Perhaps I will design another version of the
PCB, with the chip on the bottom side and without any pull-ups
whatsoever, but for now this simplified second version works well for
me.
