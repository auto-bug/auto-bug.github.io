# Analog Joysticks
Published on 2019-01-13 in {ref}`project-19371`.

I'm very happy with the version 6.0 and don't plan to make any further
changes, at least for now. It's perfect both for user interfaces and
for games. However, there is one more use case I have in mind, and
that is controlling mobile robots. For that analog joysticks would be
much better. So I sat down and designed another version, this time
with two thumb joysticks, two shoulder buttons, and two buttons on the
side for switching modes:

I kept the size the same, but this time I centered the board (the
d-pad version is a bit shifted to make room for the four fire
buttons). Also, since the thumb sticks are so big, I had to put the
shoulder buttons on the back of the board, where the microcontroller
is:

Four analog pins of the AtTiny24 are enough to handle the joystick,
and the remaining four are for the buttons — again I didn't do
anything fancy. I kept the interrupt pin and the two footprints for
displays — a robot controller could use this for telemetry, menus, or
even camera image (but that would probably require an esp32 board).

Of course the final version will have rounded corners. I should have
the boards in a few weeks, then I will adapt the code to send not only
the button status, but also the four analog measurements.
