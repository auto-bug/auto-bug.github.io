# The Screen
Published on 2021-06-14 in {ref}`project-180364`.

I'm still using the same tiny ST7735 color TFT screen, with a new PCB
added to the back of it, containing just the microcontroller and a
micro-USB socket made of the PCB itself â€” to make the whole thing as
thin as possible. I will probably need to cast it in resin eventually,
so it's a sturdy, one-piece thing. For now, for ease of debugging, I'm
keeping it separate.

I will need to make at least one more version of that PCB, to include
touch pads for switching the image on the pendant.
