# Some Progress
Published on 2021-10-01 in {ref}`project-180364`.

I had a friend visiting over the weekend, and they were interested in
this project, so we sat down together and made some progress with it.
I assembled a second unit, flashed the usual bootloader to it, and
started to work on the CircuitPython firmware with the displayio
library included.

Right away I ran into a stumbling block: displayio is too large to fit
on the SAMD21 flash by default, even with all the unneeded modules
disabled. Fortunately I had a similar problem with {ref}`project-180309` before, and I knew that reducing the size of the filesystem from 64kB
to 48kB solves that problem.

Next problem took us some more time to resolve. I copied the display
initialization code from {ref}`project-165032` , since both displays use the same ST7735, they just differ in size.
But on the pendant this code was crashing the whole firmware. It took
me some time to figure out that the PA10 pin I used as MOSI for the
display can't in fact be used as MOSI, despite what my notes say.
Instead, pin PA11 should be used. So we cut the trace, bodged the
connection to one pin to the right, and this time got working
firmware. But unfortunately with non-working display still.

Two days later I finally figured out what was wrong. I typed the value
I was writing to MADCTL register as binary value, with "0b" at the
beginning, but I forgot this is C, not Python, and that means
something else. After writing that in hex with "0x" the display
magically started working:

The next step is to write the code for decoding GIF images. I already
have [working code for CircuitPython](https://github.com/deshipu/circuitpython-gif) , so I tried that. Unfortunately (but predictably), I ran out of
memory. So next, I need to figure a way of sending the data straight
to the display, without buffering it first in RAM. I might need to use
a C library for reading that GIF file for this, we will see.
