# Goodbye
Published on 2023-09-11 in {ref}`project-180364`.

As I already wrote at {ref}`project-158701` , it's time to end this project. While I still think it should be
possible to make animated GIF images displayed with this hardware, I
simply don't have the energy to write the kind of optimized code that
would be needed, and in the meantime there are much more powerful
microcontrollers out there that can do it without a problem and as
cheaply. So I'm shelving this.

I might revisit the idea in the future, but it will probably be with a
different display and definitely with a different microcontroller.
