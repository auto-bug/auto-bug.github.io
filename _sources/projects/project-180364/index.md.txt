This is continuing the work from {ref}`project-158701`  — I had to create a new project page to submit it to the contests.

The idea is to use one of those tiny TFT screens to build a piece of
jewelry that you wear on your neck, to which you can save any animated
GIF file of the right size, to have it displayed on the screen.
