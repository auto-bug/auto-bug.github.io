# Reading GIFs in CircuitPython
Published on 2021-06-14 in {ref}`project-180364`.

This is not advertised very much, but CircuitPython can now load GIF
files using the Adafruit's Image Load library — I have added GIF
support to it a while ago, based on the example code a wrote here:  [https://github.com/deshipu/circuitpython-gif](https://github.com/deshipu/circuitpython-gif) 

However, there is one small technicality: that library doesn't handle
animated GIFs.

An animaterd GIF image actually contains multiple images inside, each
representing one frame of the animation. They can contain the whole
frame, or just the differences from the previous frame, with
everything else transparent.

I will need to modify my code to make it read one frame at a time —
the SAMD21 microcontroller I'm using probably doesn't have enough
memory to read all the frames at once. Hopefully the code will be fast
enough to animate the image reasonably well.

If that fails, I might need to include a library written in C to read
and display the animations.
