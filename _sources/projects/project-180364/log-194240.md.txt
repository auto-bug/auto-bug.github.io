# Continuing from Previous Project
Published on 2021-06-14 in {ref}`project-180364`.

I haven't touched the {ref}`project-158701` project in a while, but I think it's really time to resurrect it now.
CircuitPython has grown a lot in this time, and I also wrote a library
that reads GIF files in Python, so there is much that can be improved
on the software side.

On the hardware side, I'm going to continue where I left off. I will
use the new configuration, with the screen on one end, and the battery
holder worn on your back, under the shirt:

This allows the pendant itself to be much smaller, and the battery to
be much larger. I will probably switch to a pair of regular alkaline
AAA batteries, instead of rechargeable LiPO. They are safer and much
easier to get. Also, I don't need to ship them with the device.
