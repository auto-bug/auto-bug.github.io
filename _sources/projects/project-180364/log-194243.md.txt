# Battery Holder
Published on 2021-06-14 in {ref}`project-180364`.

A separate task is going to be designing the battery holder. For now
I'm just using an off-the-shelf battery box, with a switch on it, and
it's enough for testing, but eventually a separate special design will
probably be necessary.

There are two main problems to solve here:


 1. Since the battery holder will be worn on the back of your neck, it
will be in contact with a rather sensitive part of your body â€” I will
need to make sure it's safe for your skin.
 1. Since it's relatively large and heavy, an ergonomic shape will be
necessary.
