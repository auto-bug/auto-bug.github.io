# Learn Inkscape
Published on 2017-09-13 in {ref}`project-27257`.

If you want to do anything more advanced with Fritzing — design your
own footprints, use custom-shaped PCBs, panelize your designs, etc. —
you are going to need to edit SVG files. Fritzing itself doesn't let
you do that — the authors figured out that any crippled editor they
can make will be infinitely inferior to the general-purpose graphics
editors made by dedicated teams. So they rely on you using an external
editors. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)  is one particularly nice graphics editor that edits SVG files
natively and lets you do a lot in a very convenient way. It has grids,
rules, automatic arrangement of objects, measuring and even lets you
edit the XML attributes of elements directly. So the very first tip I
have for getting the most out of Fritzing is installing and learning
to use Inkscape.
