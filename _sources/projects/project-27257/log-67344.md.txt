# Part Libraries
Published on 2017-09-17 in {ref}`project-27257`.

Fritzing comes by default with a pretty large library of parts that
you can use in your designs, and new parts are being added to that
library all the time by various contributors. However, there are also
a few large part libraries outside of that, that you might want to add
to your installation. The biggest ones are probably the libraries of
parts made by the companies that sell those parts:


 *  [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library) 
 *  [Sparkfun](https://github.com/sparkfun/Fritzing_Parts) 
 *  [Seeedstudio](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/fritzing_parts) 

See the README in the Adafruit's library for detailed instructions on
adding those to your Fritzing.
