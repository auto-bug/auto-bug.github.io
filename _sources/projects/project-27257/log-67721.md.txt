# Net Labels
Published on 2017-09-24 in {ref}`project-27257`.

Let's talk a little bit about schematics. I know that you rarely visit
that tab, but if you want other people to actually make sense of your
project, you have to document it. Like I did with my {ref}`project-18120` :

I really tried to make it readable. However, the LED matrix has such
ridiculously random pinout, and there are so many connections, that
it's really difficult to make sense of it.

Today I'm a little bit wiser and I use the net labels, which you can
find in your parts pane under schematic view:

The way you use it, you connect it in place of a wire, and at the
other end you make another one, with the same name. Fritzing considers
all the labels with the same network name on them connected. The
resulting schematic is much easier to read, like the way I made for {ref}`project-21578` :

Of course, this is not a silver bullet. If you overdo it, and all your
connections are just some random labels, your schematic will be even
harder to read. But if you can think of a name for a given connection,
it's probably a good idea to use a label for it.\
