# Custom PCB Outline
Published on 2018-07-01 in {ref}`project-27257`.

One of the greatest advantages of Fritzing over other PCB software
currently on the market is its ability to SVG files directly, without
any need of converting or tracing them. Since it uses SVG internally
for anything, it's only natural that the PCB outline is also an SVG
file. I'm going to tell you here how I go about making custom PCB
outlines.

Usually I start by designing everything on a standard rectangular PCB,
keeping in mind the rough shape that I am going to need. Here's an
improved design for the {ref}`project-9769`  with a power switch added:

Next, I export the design as an SVG image:

Then I open it in Inkscape, where I can easily draw my desired board
outline:

Usually I pick some nice, partially transparent color (green, blue and
purple work well) and draw the shape of the PCB I want with it:

You can also add some silkscreen:

Next, I remove all the Fritzing stuff from the image, and leave only
the board outline and the silkscreen:

Now create a new layer in Inkscape using_Layer→Add Layer..._ menu option, and name it "board". Select the board outline, and then
select_Layer→Move Selection to Layer..._, then select the newly created layer "board". Repeat that with the
silkscreen, except call it "silkscreen0" for the bottom, or
"silkscreen1" for the top (you can have both). 

We are almost done. Unfortunately, Inkscape doesn't call the layers
the way you tell it — it only adds labels to them with your names. We
will need to go a little bit deeper to actually modify the layer IDs.
Open the XML Editor, you should see something like this:

Now you can select each of the layers, select the "id" attribute on
the right side, and enter new value for it on the bottom. Change the
IDs to "board", "silkscreen0", "silkscreen1", etc. so that they match
the labels. Don't forget to click Set each time, or it won't get
saved.

You are done. Now you can save your board as "Plain SVG", and go back
to Fritzing. In Fritzing, select the PCB, and in the properties click
on the_load image file_ button:

Select your saved SVG image. You should see a summary telling you how
many cutouts (slots) your PCB has — make sure that number is correct.
Finally, you will need to adjust the position of your PCB to match the
components, and you are done:

Now, when you export the board as gerbers, I recommend to do one more
step before you send it to fabrication: open the board outline in a
gerber viewer, such as "gerbv" and verify that the generated shape is
indeed correct. Fritzing has some very annoying bugs around the gerber
generation, and you might be unpleasantly surprised if you skip this
step.

This time everything is correct. If it wasn't, I would go back to
Inkscape and add a couple of nodes to the shape, around the places
where something went wrong, to make sure it's correct.
