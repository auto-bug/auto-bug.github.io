# Tented Vias
Published on 2018-07-02 in {ref}`project-27257`.

This trick was originally described by [@Arduino Enigma ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/72667) in the {ref}`project-91895` . Tented vias are vias that are covered with soldermask. If you think
about it for a moment, there is really no reason for a via to be
exposed (unless you re-use it as a test point). Its job is to connect
the layers, and it does it as well when it is covered. On the other
hand, when it's covered, the risk of shorting it is smaller, and the
board can look much better.

Unfortunately Fritzing doesn't normally give you the option to have
the vias tented. But there is a simple trick to add the soldermask
over them when you are generating the gerbers. Start by generating
your gerber files as usual, and once you do that, select_Routing→Select All Vias_ from the menu, and press the Del key to delete them. It will also
delete some of the traces, but don't worry about it. Now generate
another set of gerber files, in a separate directory, and close
Fritzing without saving the file.

Now all you have to do is to copy the_maskTop, maskBottom, silkTop_ and_silkBottom_ files from the latter directory to the former, and voila, your vias
are now covered with soldermask. You can also only copy only some of
those files to only have the vias covered on one side of the board.
