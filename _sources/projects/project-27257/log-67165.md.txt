# Ratsnest Lines
Published on 2017-09-15 in {ref}`project-27257`.

One of the nicest features of Fritzing is that it lets you easily
switch between the schematic and PCB views, and the updates you make
in one will show in the other in the form of so called "ratsnest"
lines — color dashed lines.

However, while generally useful, they can become very problematic when
too dense, because of one peculiarity of Fritzing — the ratsnest lines
have clicking priority over everything else, so it may be very
difficult to click on anything covered by them. A quick workaround is
to double-click on the offending lines to turn them into traces, which
obey normal clicking priority rules and are not as problematic, but
then it's hard to keep track of what you have already connected in
your design.

A better way is to simply disable the display of the ratsnest layer.
You can do that in the menu, by clicking on the checkbox next to
View→Ratsnest Layer. But then how are you going to know what to
connect to what? Don't worry, if you click on any pin, Fritzing will
highlight all the other pins it should be connected to — this way you
can make all your connections while avoiding visual clutter.

Though I still wish there was an option of making the ratsnest lines
unclickable...
