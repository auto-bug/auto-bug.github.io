# Hole Sizes
Published on 2017-09-14 in {ref}`project-27257`.

When Fritzing was created, we didn't have anything like OSHPark, and
most hobbyist were making their PCBs manually at home. That included
drilling. That's probably why the Fritzing defaults to 1mm hole sizes
with a preety wide copper circle around them — it's simply much easier
to do by hand.

But today, when we send our PCBs to fabricators who use automated
processes for everything, it doesn't make much sense, and the huge
holes and pads mean it's impossible to route a track between them.

Fortunately, you can change the sizes of holes for your headers, using
the "hole size" settings:

You have three pre-sets, but you can also enter your own numbers, and
they will be remembered as one more preset. Personally I like using
0.9mm for the hole diameter and 0.4mm for the ring thickness — this
gives pretty good fit for the male headers, with enough copper to
solder them to, and enough room between the pins to fit a trace
comfortably.
