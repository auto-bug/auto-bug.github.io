Will ESP32-S3 work in a keyboard?

The ESP32-S3 is the first Espressif board that has both true USB and
Bluetooth, so naturally you have to wonder if it's any good for
keyboards. I decided to try and see.

I'm using [@Unexpected Maker](https://hackaday.io/hacker/264362) 's [TinyS3](https://tinys3.com)  boards that just arrived from Australia, hence the board's name. And
the fact it's shaped a little bit like a sandwich, if you squint a
little.

It's also my first board where I'm using switch sockets, so you can
rearrange and replace the switches on it as you like.
