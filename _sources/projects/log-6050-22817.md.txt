# Version 4 of PCB Documented
Published on 2015-08-15 in {ref}`project-6050`.

After building two prototypes and testing them, I decided to make the
version 4 of the PCB the default in [the documentation](http://tote.readthedocs.org/) . There are also [updated assembly instructions](http://tote.readthedocs.org/en/latest/assembly_v4.html)  with lots of photos. Don't worry, the [instructions for the old boards are still there](http://tote.readthedocs.org/en/latest/assembly_v2.html) .
