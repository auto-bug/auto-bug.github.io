    As the name implies, this is a keyboard that is supposed to make it
easier to move from the traditional keyboards to the more ergonomic
ones. I used a Planck in this role before, but I noticed that
introducing both layers and ortholinear layout is too big of a step at
once. So I decided to design a board that is minimal in terms of the
size, but still uses a more traditional, staggered key layout. I also
wanted to have at most 1.5U keys, so that I don't have to muck about
with stabilizers. So I came up with this layout:

Then, when choosing what switches to use, I noticed that Kailh Choc
Purpz are on sale. To match those, I also decided to make the PCB
purple, and use transparent key caps.

The brains is still the good old SAMD21 chip, running CircuitPython
and my uKeeb library.
