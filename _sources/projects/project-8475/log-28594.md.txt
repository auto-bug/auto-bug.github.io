# Programming
Published on 2015-12-02 in {ref}`project-8475`.

Once I had the mechanics done, I started to work on the programming.
Setting the speed of the servos was easy enough:


```python
import microbit

microbit.pin0.set_analog_period(20)
microbit.pin0.write_analog(int(25 + 100 * degrees / 180))
```

But then making it turn exactly 90Â° or travel exactly 10cm required
some careful experimentation with timing.

Once I had that, hooking up the distance sensor was easy. It's an
analog SHARP range finder, so all I needed was to read the analog pin.
Then I added some simple logic for finding out in which direction the
obstacle is further away, and voila, object avoidance:

And that's it. All the code sits in the repository: [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micro-bot/src](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micro-bot/src)
