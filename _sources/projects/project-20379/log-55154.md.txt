# Lessons Learned
Published on 2017-03-19 in {ref}`project-20379`.


 * Inverse kinematics of delta robots are actually simpler than those of
arms
 * Accuracy depends heavily on the play in various parts
 * Some cheap servos have a lot of play -- I think even SG90 servos would
have been better
 * Ball joints can have some play too -- make sure to get ones with
smaller balls
 * Unused PCBs make great building material, if you just remember to add
holes in your designs
 * Having a bag of nuts and bolts in your drawer is great
 * Paperclips can be soldered to PCBs and make great loops for bolting
things to
 * When figuring out kinematics, don't draw your robot in the neutral
position
