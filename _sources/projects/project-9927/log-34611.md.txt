# LiPo Chargers
Published on 2016-03-26 in {ref}`project-9927`.

The conference is nearing, and I'm still waiting for the parts. I
really hope that they will arrive on time. I'm not quite panicking
yet, but soon I will probably start.

While waiting for the parts, I still need to write the remaining code
for the ESP8266 (and possibly improve the code for the Arduino). Today
I didn't even have enough concentration to do that, so instead I
started soldering things. I still don't have all the parts to solder
the PCBs, but I started with the LiPo chargers. The batteries I got
have JST plugs on them, which easily plug into standard 2.54mm
headers. But sooner or later someone will plug them in reverse, and if
you do that with a cheap LiPo charger, you could have a fire. So I
soldered proper JST sockets to all ten chargers (that's how many I
have, as that was the initial count for the workshop, you will have to
share).

I can already tell that soldering the remainder of the kits is going
to be a full-time job. Hopefully the parts will arrive next week, so I
have a weekend to do that.
