# This is not the robot you are looking for
Published on 2023-03-16 in {ref}`project-9927`.

Apparently there are some rumors that this is a robot we are going to
be building at a workshop in Berlin during the 2023 Hackaday
conference. That is not true.

This is the robot we were building back in 2016 in Belgrade.

Yes, there is going to be a robot-building robot in Berlin, but we are
going to be building {ref}`project-180025` , which is a newer design with many improvements.
