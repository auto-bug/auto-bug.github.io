# Prototyping and Controller Code
Published on 2016-03-06 in {ref}`project-9927`.

With the addition of ESP8266, Tote will now have two processors on
board, and it makes sense to split the responsibilities for them a
little bit. The ATmega328p on the Pro Mini is relatively slow (8Mhz)
and weak, but has a lot of inputs and outputs, which makes it perfect
as the servo controller, and generally as the spinal cord of the
robot, controlling low-level reflexes. The ESP8266 is much stronger
and faster (it has to be to handle WiFi), and so it could handle
higher-level functions.

Because the time is precious, I started to work on the code for the
Pro Mini already. I made a prototype using one of the older boards,
but with the new leg configuration, and with some cables for
connecting the ESP8266 to it:

Now I'm copy-pasting bits and pieces of the original Tote code, and
adding some IÂ²C communication on top of that. Basically, the ESP8266
will be sending coordinates for the legs to the Pro Mini, and it will
handle leg inverse kinematics.
