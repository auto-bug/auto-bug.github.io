     {ref}`project-6050`  is a spider-like quadruped robot. While its small size and plastic
parts make it look like a toy, it was in fact designed as a platform
for experimenting with walking robots. Unlike many toys that have
their gaits hard-wired, Tote has individual control over each of its
legs, with three degrees of freedom, using inverse kinematics
calculations. This gives it great flexibility, and makes it possible
to implement gaits that let it walk on uneven terrain, and even climb
obstacles! Of course it can also dance.

There are also a lot of options for extending it. While initially Tote
doesn't have any sensors, it's possible to give it touch, sight, force
sensing, hearing and sense of balance, by simply adding appropriate
sensors, connecting them to the free pins, and -- of course --
programming new behaviors based on their reports.

Even without the extra sensors, Tote can be quite useful. It's small
and portable, so it can be conveniently transported. It's sturdy,
flexible and relatively weak -- which makes it quite safe to handle.
And it's complex enough to explore the problems of robot walking and
test new algorithms.

## Instructions



Connect the tibia to the femur and coxa. Be careful to not rotate the
servos -- if you do, switch the robot on for a moment so that they
center again. Make sure the tibia is horizontal and the femur is
vertical. Make sure to use the horn screws that came with the servos.

---


Screw a servo horn to the robot's body. Since the size of the outside
of the servo horn has large range, the holes in the board may be too
small for it -- if that's the case, file the plastic horn to make it
fit.

---


Attach the leg to the body. Again, make sure you don't move the servo
from its center position, and that the leg sticks out at 45° angle.

:::


Make sure the femur is facing towards the side of the robot, not
forward or backward.




---


Repeat for all the legs. Switch the robot on again and make sure all
the legs are in their default positions, with femurs vertical, tibias
horizontal, and coxas sticking out at 45°.

---


Start by assembling the legs. You will need two "left" legs, and two
"right" ones, which are mirror images of the "left" legs. Instructions
below are for just one "left" leg.


---


Glue together the two servos making up the coxa. Make sure to apply
glue on all surfaces that touch, including the "ears".

---


Cut off the shorter side of the "cross" horn, as shown below:

And then attach it with one of the servo mounting screws to the tibia
servo:

---


Screw together the horns that form the tibia. You may need to cut the
tips of the horns, if they are too long.

:::


Alternatively, if you don't have the right size of screws, you can
glue the horns together, or use thin wire instead of screws.


---


Connect all the servo plugs to the body. Make sure that the yellow
wire is towards the center of the board, and the brown wire towards
the edge.

---


Connect the battery (pay attention to the + and -), and switch the
robot on for a moment, so that all the servos go into their center
positions. Switch it off.
