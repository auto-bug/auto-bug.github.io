# Walking with Python
Published on 2016-03-27 in {ref}`project-9927`.

Today I finally sat down and wrote the Python part of the code for
walking. Just the basic creep gait for now. I works, but there seems
to be a problem with the IÂ²C communication -- as I mentioned
previously already, I'm getting OSError sometimes when sending the
coordinates to the controller. It turns out that sometimes when that
happens, the slave ends up stuck in a state where it won't listen to
commands anymore, and has to be restarted.

I looked at the signals with a scope, and I'm pretty sure this is not
due to noise on the line or inadequate pull-up resistors. I tried
halving the resistors just to make sure, but of course no improvement.
I suspect it's a race condition in the software I2C implementation on
the ESP8266. Hopefully that will be fixed before the conference.

In the worst case, I will put all the gait code back on the Arduino
and just use ESP8266 for remote control, but it would be so much
better if you could program it with Python directly.
