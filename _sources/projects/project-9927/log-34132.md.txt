# Parts Trickling In
Published on 2016-03-19 in {ref}`project-9927`.

It has been over three weeks since I ordered the parts for 10 kits,
and they have started to trickle in slowly. I'm putting them all in
one box for now. If you ever wondered how a box of 40 servos looks
like:

One of the packages with 40 servos is held by customs -- they
requested clarification of what it is and how much it costs, and since
I've been traveling the whole last week, I will be only able to send
it to them on Monday. One more package is still on the way -- with 12
servos per robot, ten kits makes 120 servos.

In the mean time I learned that in the end we will need 25 kits, so I
quickly ordered additional parts, with some faster shipping.
Fortunately they are cheaper in bulk, so that actually evens out the
shipping costs. Next time I'm doing it, I'm going to order 300 servos
instead of 120 -- due to the magic of bulk orders, the price is
roughly the same.

Same goes for the printed circuit boards. At DirtyPCBs, whether you
order 20 or 30 boards, the price is the same...
