# First Steps
Published on 2016-04-04 in {ref}`project-9927`.

With the kits all soldered and ready, I'm focusing on the software
development. As usual, I won't have everything I wanted there at
first, so expect software updates after the workshop. However, the
basic walking is a must, so I'm focusing on that. The Micropython for
ESP8266 is actually usable enough now, and I only needed a small patch
to slow down the IÂ²C communication, so that the Arduino can keep up
without clock stretching. After doing that, and adding the Python code
to the scripts directory, I compiled a working version of the
firmware. Here are the first steps of the robot:

Of course for now the walking is slowed down (with long pauses between
movements) and the leg reach is small -- it should be much faster and
smoother when I tune it. I will also need to add a way to control it
over WiFi, and to read any sensors connected to the Arduino. By
default, there is going to be only one telemetry value you can read,
the battery voltage, but of course you can connect pretty much any
sensor you can think of.

Also note that the front left hip servo is broken and only moves into
two positions -- that's because I had to use recycled servos for the
prototype. On the workshop we will use the new servos that just
arrived, and they should all be fine.
