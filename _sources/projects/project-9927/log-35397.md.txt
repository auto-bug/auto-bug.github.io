# Software
Published on 2016-04-07 in {ref}`project-9927`.

I finished the Arduino code and flashed to all the boards, and now I'm
in the process of flashing the Python code onto all the ESP-01
modules, and setting their SSIDs.

As usual, the software doesn't do all that I wanted it to do. By
default it makes the robot walk forward and listen for connections. I
wrote a small PyGame program that lets you control the robot from your
computer with the keyboard. That's it.

Things I wanted but didn't have time to do:


 * there is only the "creep" gait, no "trot" gait,
 * the communication with the Arduino controller is one-way, no
telemetry,
 * thus, no battery voltage monitoring,
 * there is no remote Python console, for that you have to connect the
serial cable.

However, all that can come in the future versions of the software.
During the workshop I will show you how to modify and flash the
software for both of the microcontrollers, so hopefully you will be
able to perform the updates when new versions become available here.

Oh, the code repository is at: [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote-had/src](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote-had/src)
