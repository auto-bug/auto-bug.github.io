# Workshop Preparations
Published on 2016-02-29 in {ref}`project-9927`.

Since my workshop was accepted, I started preparing for it. First of
all, I went and ordered all the required parts from Aliexpress, since
you can never tell how long it will take them to reach here. I split
the order into many small packages, so even if some of them don't
arrive on time, I will be able to replace them with the parts from my
personal stock.

Second, since I needed to order the printed circuit boards, I decided
to redesign them a little bit, both to include the Jolly Wrencher
logo, and to include some of the improvements that I came up with
since the last iteration. More on that later.

Once the boards and parts are here, I will need to build and test one
prototype, and then pre-assemble all the boards. I think that at the
least I will have to do all the soldering -- because I really don't
think I will be able to teach people to solder during the workshop,
and I don't want injuries.

While building the prototype, I will make the photographs illustrating
all the steps, and upload them here as the instructions. Then I will
have them printed for the workshops.

Finally, there will be some changes in the software. I already did
some preliminary experiments, and I think that I can make the whole
thing much easier to experiment with.
