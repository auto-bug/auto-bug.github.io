# Clock Stretching Woes
Published on 2016-03-30 in {ref}`project-9927`.

The parts are still trickling in, but I'm waiting for the rest of the
PCBs to start the mass-production of the workshop kits. Hopefully they
will arrive tomorrow or Friday, so I can do it over the weekend.

Less good news is that the tracking number for the 200 servos that I
ordered a week ago is not working (the seller gave me 4 different ones
so far, none working). It's too late to order this from a different
seller, and there is no brick-and-mortar shop that I know that has
those. So it's possible that I will have only 10 complete kits, and 15
kits without legs. I'm still hoping that the servos will arrive on
time, but there is nothing I can do with this. Frustrating.

Finally, on the software side, I made some progress debugging the I²C
issues (after two evenings of analyzing the scope). I even found and
tried a completely [new slave library by Pololu](https://github.com/pololu/pololu-rpi-slave-arduino-library) , but decided to switch back to Wire.h for now (I might use that
library later, especially since it has a workaround for the I²C bug in
Raspberry Pi). Anyways, the issue seems to be that the Arduino slave
is sometimes too slow for the 100kHz I²C, and the ESP8266
implementation doesn't support clock stretching, so it can't slow down
when needed. The good part is that I found a way to compile a version
of the firmware with slower I²C, so this shouldn't be a problem.
