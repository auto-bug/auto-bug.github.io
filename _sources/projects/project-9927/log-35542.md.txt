# Quick Notes
Published on 2016-04-09 in {ref}`project-9927`.

The workshop just finished, and I will have more to say about it, but
for now I need to take a couple of notes for improving things, in case
I will be doing it again.


 * Cheap screwdrivers are useless,
 * The screws that come with servos are really bad for this, make sure to
use the 1.5x3M screws,
 * Check the software also in the AP mode, not just when it's connected
to your home WiFi,
 * Investigate the glue-less approach to making feet,
 * Provide more detailed instructions. Separate instructions for left and
right legs, better instructions for what to plug where, mark the
colors for B&W prints,
 * Tell people to use the servo horns that came in the bag with the
servo, as they differ very much for servos from different sources.
 * Order plastic bags and divide the parts into kits. Make sure to use
servos from the same source in each kit,
 * Add instructions for cutting off the servo "ears" for the hip servos,
 * More detailed instructions for centering the servos,
 * Tell the organizers about the upper limit on the number of people in
advance. Order everything at once, in bulk,
 * The cheap LiPo chargers are 1A, not good for batteries smaller than
1000mAh,
 * Have enough USB2TTLs for everyone to use,
 * Double-check all the boards for soldering errors and missing parts,
 * Bringing a soldering iron and basic tools was a great idea,
 * Send the kits to the organizers as a package, to avoid customs
problems at the airport,
 * Tell people to bring laptops,
 * Add web interface,
 * Have it blink LEDs in different patterns to indicate different stages
and/or errors,
 * Print the address of the project website on the instructions and the
PCB,
 * Have a helper for every 10 people,
 * 4h is barely enough to assemble everything, forget about programming
them,
 * If servos are erratic, check the battery,
 * People who came are amazing! Thanks!
