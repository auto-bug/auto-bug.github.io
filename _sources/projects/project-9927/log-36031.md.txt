# 3D printed body
Published on 2016-04-16 in {ref}`project-9927`.

Hey all, [@davedarko](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459)  writing. As you might have seen at the {ref}`project-8672`  event - I've brought my Tote with 3d printed legs along to the
workshop. There I was asked for the files and [@Radomir Dopieralski](https://hackaday.io/hacker/35249)  told me I could share them in a log. It took me a while to chamfer
some edges and fix the hip orientation of my design, but now I finally
have all the parts in a presentable state. You can find the STL files
for printing in the file section. The design files are made with 123D
Design by Autodesk. That's the 3rd time I completely disassembled my
Tote.

<hr >These are the hip parts, that you have to glue together. I've marked
them with text so it is easier to spot how to glue them together. You
will need 2 of each displayed parts.

<hr >You will need to print two of each version of which there are two.
These are the feet by the way.

<hr >Print the legs part 8 times and glue them back to back, so that the
servo mounts are on the same side.

<hr >This is the baseplate that sadly doesn't connect to anything. You have
to hold everything together with one or two zipties wrapped around
everything, since the holes are blocked by the legs and servo mounts.
