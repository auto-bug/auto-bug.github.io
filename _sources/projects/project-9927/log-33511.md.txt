# Updated PCB
Published on 2016-03-11 in {ref}`project-9927`.

I fixed the PCB, and updated the link in the bill of materials to
point to the new version. I also ordered the updated boards -- if they
arrive before the workshop, we will use them. Otherwise there will be
this additional jumper wire on all of them...
