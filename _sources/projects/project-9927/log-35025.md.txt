I'm still waiting for 20 batteries, but hopefully they will arrive
sometime next week.

I finally can start assembling the PCBs for the kits. I already did

You can see some unpopulated headers and footprints there -- that's
because they are optional, and the parts I got are not enough to fill
them on all 25 boards. But that also means that you can improve your
robot even further once you take it home. I will be posting detailed
instructions here about each optional feature, so that hopefully this
will be easy. We can also talk about this on the workshop, if there is
time.
