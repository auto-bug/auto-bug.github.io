# Fixed Firmware
Published on 2016-04-11 in {ref}`project-9927`.

As promised, I fixed the firmware for the robot -- now it will start
walking immediately after being switched on, and after connecting you
can control it. Below are flashing instructions.


 1. Download the [firmware-combined.bin](https://cdn.hackaday.io/files/9927424716768/firmware-combined.bin)  file, and save in the current directory.
 1. Download the [esptool.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themadinventor/esptool/master/esptool.py)  file, and save in the current directory.
 1. Connect the USB2TTL to the pins on the side of the robot:
  * gnd ↔ gnd
  * rx ↔ tx
  * tx ↔ rx


 1. Connect together two pin holes (or pins, if you soldered pins in
there) on the other side of the robot (leave the third pin alone):
  * gnd ↔ sda


 1. Connect the USB2TTL to your computer.
 1. Switch on the robot.
 1. Run the flashing command:
```bash
$ python esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=8m 0 firmware-combined.bin
```


 On Windows/Mac change the path to the USB2TTL port accordingly.

 1. Wait for the firmware to flash. If you get an error, try again.
 1. Switch the robot off.
 1. Remove the connector from the pin holes.
 1. Switch the robot on and see it walk. Congratulations, you have the new
firmware.

Note, that flashing new firmware will not delete the network
information from the board, if you had the robot connect to some
network. If you want to do that, you can with this command (before
flashing the firmware):


```sql
$ python esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash
```
