# Improved Knees
Published on 2016-07-25 in {ref}`project-8643`.

We've build a couple of those robots at the Europython, thanks to
everyone who worked on that! We also managed to come up with an
improvement to the fragile knees this robot has. Instead of gluing
those small rectangles of foamed pvc to the servo horns, simply melt
the horn's plastic with a lighter and fuse them together. Makes them
much stronger!
