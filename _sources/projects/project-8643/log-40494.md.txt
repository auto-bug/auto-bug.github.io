# Micro:Bob MK II
Published on 2016-06-23 in {ref}`project-8643`.

I was asked to re-make Micro:Bob for an upcoming conference (the
original travels the world with the Micro:bit World Tour, and its
exact location is at the moment unknown). Inspired by {ref}`project-12275`  I decided to make a robot that has a more robot-ey shape -- looks
like the ones in the old TV programs, or comic books.

The electronics and software didn't change so far (OK, I added LEDs
for the eyes), it's mostly about the looks.

I also took photos as I went this time, so you can see the whole build
process, and maybe have some insight in how I make the design
decisions as I go.
