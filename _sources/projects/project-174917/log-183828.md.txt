# Fork
Published on 2020-09-20 in {ref}`project-174917`.

I'm splitting this project from {ref}`project-174095` , because it has acquired life of its own, the keyboard being my main
daily keyboard now. I'm still doing some cosmetic tweaks and changes
to the layout and code, but it is mostly as I want it to be, and it's
way more comfortable than traditional keyboards.

So just to catch up from the previous project: I made this minimal,
40-key keyboard with low-profile chocolate switches just to see if
such a small keyboard layout could even work. It turned out that it
not only works, but makes it much easier to learn touch typing for me,
so I started using it as my default keyboard. After a few days I
identified a few annoyances, some of which I was able to fix with
layout tweaks, but some required extra keys to be present. So I
designed a bigger version with a popular "planck" layout. And that's
where we are now.
