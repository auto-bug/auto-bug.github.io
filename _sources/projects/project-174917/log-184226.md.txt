# Assembly
Published on 2020-09-29 in {ref}`project-174917`.

Since I forked this project from {ref}`project-174095` , most of the technical details are there, so I thought it makes sense
to repeat it a little bit. I decided on a very minimal design — just
the PCB, no support plate and no case.

So this is basically just the PCB with the switches soldered directly
on it. The microcontroller had to be squeezed in there between the
switches, because the back needs to stay flat, so that I can cover it
with foam stickers.

They don't look so great because I had to remove and re-attach them a
couple of times while I worked on the keyboard. They look much better
freshly applied, but I didn't take that photo.

Since the USB port didn't fit between the keys, I decided to go with a
permanently attached USB cable. It's soldered to the header, and then
glued to the PCB using a glue-soaked fabric ribbon, which also acts as
stress relief for the cable.
