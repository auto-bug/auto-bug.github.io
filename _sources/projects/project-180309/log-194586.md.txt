# Version 2
Published on 2021-06-23 in {ref}`project-180309`.

Second attempt, with longer battery tabs â€” so they will hopefully have
enough flex in them to hold the battery without breaking. I also had
to re-route some traces, as there wasn't enough room around the holes
anymore. Finally, I added fancier silkscreen on the front. I'm
thinking this time I will use a red PCB, so that the traces are not so
apparent on the front.
