# Designing the Battery Holder
Published on 2021-06-11 in {ref}`project-180309`.

Touch buttons and a USB socket are relatively easy to make, and I did
them before. But a battery holder is a new thing, and it requires some
thought. I made a number of sketches:

But eventually I decided to got with the simplest possible design that
just might work:

Here is how it's supposed to work:

I'm not entirely sure how elastic the PCB will be, and how much I will
need to bend it, so I assume some experimenting will be needed. I
started with relatively short but thin tabs. I also included a
footprint for a regular battery holder on top of it, so that if my
first design doesn't work, I can still use the boards to test and
prototype other parts.
