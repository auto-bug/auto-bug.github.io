# First Module
Published on 2021-02-08 in {ref}`project-175712`.

Remember how I tricked myself into not diving into the rabbit hole of
what could be possibly placed in the middle of this keyboard by making
an expansion module header in there? Well, it would be nice to
actually have a module to place there. So I designed this:

It's a basic set: a joystick for mouse emulation, two buttons for
mouse clicks, and an encoder knob for scrolling. The PCB was super-
basic:

I also placed some LEDs for "backlight" in there, but since I ran out
of pins to control it, I just added a simple mechanical switch:

It doesn't work too great:

Probably side-mounted LEDs would have been better.

I still need to write the code for the encoder, but since
CircuitPython has a ready library for it, it shouldn't be too hard.
