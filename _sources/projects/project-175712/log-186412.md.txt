# Promises are Made to be Broken
Published on 2020-11-25 in {ref}`project-175712`.

I promised the last one Kamina will be the last try for my ultimate
keyboard, and it was indeed so close to the ideal that for a time I
considered the project done. However, I found just two little things
that could be improved, so inevitably, when I was ordering PCBs, I
added this one more to the order:

So what changed? First, there is one more column on the right hand
side of the keyboard, so that I can have my ";:" and "+=" keys on the
base layer. Second, there is an extension header in the middle, which
can be used to add a variety of modules, from a PSP joystick, through
an encoder with a knob, a display, or even exotic stuff like a gesture
sensor.

I moved all the switches and components to the new PCB and amended the
layout:
