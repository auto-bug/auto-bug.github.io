# Update
Published on 2021-07-28 in {ref}`project-175712`.

I'm still using this keyboard as my everyday main keyboard, and of
course there has been some development in the mean time.

I've made two more modules for the center, and a "blank" one to just
make it look better. I also replaced the buttons on those modules with
buttons specifically made for mice, so they have the exact feel and
click you know from clicking your mouse button. It seems like a small
thing, but actually it's a huge improvement. The module with the
silver knobs is a joystick and a scrollwheel, and both can be pushed
down for clicking too. They are not particularly convenient.

The last thing is a "trackpad" module from a smartphone that I am
working on at {ref}`project-180472` project — when I get it working, it will be another module for this
keyboard.

There have also been some other changes. I swapped the Ins and Del
keys with the bracket keys eventually, so that they are on the same
hand as on regular keyboard — that works better for me for copying and
pasting. I also moved around the media keys (used witth the Fn key) to
make them easier to remember. Oh, and Fn+Tab is now Compose.

I also added the improvements that came with the [new version of CircuitPython](https://hackaday.io/project/174095-dorsch-40k-keyboard/log/195783-shiny-new-code)  — matrix scanning done in C using the keypad module, boot.py
disabling the USB drive and UART console unless a key was pressed when
booting, and custom HID bitmap NKRO reports.

Finally, I've also sent one spare PCB to a person interested in
building this — haven't heard what they built with it yet.

One thing that I hoped to do was replacing the keycaps with the [MBK Legend](https://boardsource.xyz/store/5ffa403622bbb0151bfef66d)  ones, alas, the group buy is delayed and they are still working on
producing them — the current estimate is shipping by the end of the
year.
