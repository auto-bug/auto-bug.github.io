# PyGamer
Published on 2019-06-17 in {ref}`project-164929`.

Two news here. First of all, the Stage library now has support for the
PyGamer device, so you can play all the games on it. The analog
joystick is translated into button presses.

Second, the official displayio library grew support for partial screen
updates, which makes it much faster â€” sufficiently to replace the
Stage library in the future. So far I have ported the bouncing balls
demo to it, and I'm working on the remaining games. I also plan to
write some tutorials.
