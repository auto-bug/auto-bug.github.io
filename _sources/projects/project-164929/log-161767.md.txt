# Stage Library
Published on 2019-04-13 in {ref}`project-164929`.

I have now ported the {ref}`project-80626` to CircuitPython's 4.0 displayio system, so now it runs on any of the
Adafruit boards. Here is the Jumper Wire example game running on the
PyBadge:

The screen on the PyBadge is a bit larger, so you can see a bit of
trash on the right hand side of the screen. If the game was written
for a bigger screen, it wouldn't be there.

Unfortunately the Stage library is sensitive to how the MADCTL
register of the display is set, as it doesn't do rotation in software.
That means I had to modify the initialization code on the pybadge, to
make it fit what ugame does. Fortunately displayio doesn't care, as it
does have software rotation, so the two could be brought in sync.

The sound on the prototype of PyBadge I have is pretty bad, so I have
sound disabled in this demo. Hopefully the final version will be
better.
