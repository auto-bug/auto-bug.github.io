    Adafruit's PyBadge is coming soon, and I got my hands on a prototype.
Now I will do science to it.

What is PyBadge? It's a handheld device the size of a credit card with
a display, a bunch of buttons, a microcontroller running CircuitPython
and a bunch of extras (neopixels, accelerometer, speaker, flash
storage, battery charging, light sensor). It is also a secretly a
Feather, as you can connect FeatherWings to it.

It is similar to, but much more powerful than my earlier project {ref}`project-27629` (and the reason why I paused work on {ref}`project-86818` ). I should be able to get my libraries and games from ÂµGame to run on
it, but I hope that I can also do some other fun things with it.
