# Adafruit Learn Guide
Published on 2019-06-30 in {ref}`project-164929`.

I wrote a learn guide for Adafruit for using the Stage library on the
PyGamer and PyBadge consoles. You can find it here:  [https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-stage-game-library](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-stage-game-library) 

It's basically a re-hashing of the bouncing-ball tutorial from µGame
documentation, but slightly adjusted. Hopefully it will get people
started on writing games with CircuitPython.
