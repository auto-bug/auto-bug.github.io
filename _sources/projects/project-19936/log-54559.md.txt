# The Base
Published on 2017-03-07 in {ref}`project-19936`.

So this is a successor of the {ref}`project-8643`  robot, that would be a little less "gangsta". I designed a PCB for
attaching everything together -- the micro:bit, the servos and the
battery -- so that you don't have an ungodly mess of wires held
together with two-sided tape. I also left some extra holes in the PCB
to which you can solder paperclips, to build on top of it and make it
a little more interesting.

I found a nice method of mounting the micro:bit to the PCB without
using the bulky edge connection -- just use loops of wire made out of
paperclips, and plastic bolts (to not damage the micro:bit). The
servos fit right into the slots -- I just made the screw holes a bit
too tight, had to enlarge them a bit later. The battery holder is
still attached to the backs of the servos with a two-sided tape --
there is no room on the board for a different way of attaching it,
unfortunately.

In hindsight, I should have made more sockets for the servos --
letting you to plug several servos to the same pin, so they move
together, so that you can make hands that move together with the legs,
etc. -- maybe in the next version.
