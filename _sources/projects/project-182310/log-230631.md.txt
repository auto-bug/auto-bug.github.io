# Results
Published on 2024-06-20 in {ref}`project-182310`.

I just realized that I never updated this project with the results of
my experiment.

In short, I'm disappointed.

I was hoping the muscle memory and learning from a traditional split
keyboard would transfer to this layout, but it turns out that our
muscle memory seems to operate in terms of absolute positions, not
relative movements, and that rotating the keyboard by 90Â° and flipping
it completely defeats any learning you might have benefited from from
use of a regular keyboard.

The keyboard is possible to use, but you basically have to learn to
type on it from scratch.
