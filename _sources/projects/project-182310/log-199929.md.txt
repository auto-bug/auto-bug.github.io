# Version One
Published on 2021-11-02 in {ref}`project-182310`.

I assembled the first version of the device, and tested it
mechanically (I still need to write the code for it). As far as I can
tell so far, mechanically it should work, though the thumb keys are
pretty awkward, and the whole thing is really sensitive to the size of
one's palms.
