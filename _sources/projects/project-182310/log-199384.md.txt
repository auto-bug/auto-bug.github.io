# PCB Design
Published on 2021-10-24 in {ref}`project-182310`.

I'm going to start with just a very simple mechanical design, just a
PCB with the switches on both sides. I can think about improvements if
the basic idea proves workable. So after compiling the very latest
version of Fritzing (the appimage they released doesn't work on my
system), I went to work and created this:

Yes, the traces have right angle bends. I don't care. This is a
prototype. I can clean it up some other time.

I also added a joystick and a d-pad on the front side, for those
moments when you are not typing. The USB socket is on the bottom,
because that's where many devices have their socket as well â€” you can
use a short OTG cable to connect them.
