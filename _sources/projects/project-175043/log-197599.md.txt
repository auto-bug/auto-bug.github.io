Published on 2021-09-08 in {ref}`project-175043`.

When I first built Flatreus, it seemed pretty nice, but way too small
for me. I wasn't yet used to using layers, and I wanted to at least
have all the navigation and control keys (Esc, Enter, Backspace, Del,
etc.) easily accessible. So I designed a version of Flatreus with an
extra column of keys added on each side. The idea was to make it work
more like a Planck or {ref}`project-174917` . I ordered the PCBs, but I never assembled them, because by the time
they arrived I was already experimenting with {ref}`project-175712` , and moved on from there.

Recently, I impulse-bought some Kailh Purpz switches (there is a sale
on Aliexpress), and wanted to try them on something — so I dug out the
PCBs and finally assembled them:

Of course in the mean time I learned a lot more about layers and
minimalist keyboards, and I figured out a system for making my own
layout on any new keyboard. So the layout I ended up with is a bit
different than I initially had in mind when designing this.

I used the keychron keycaps, because I have them lying around all the
time, since they are so bad, that I always replace them with something
else whenever I can. The switches are pretty nice — they are linears
with 25g springs, very light in touch. Switching back to my Kamina
with clicky Choc Whites makes me really feel how strong I have to push
on the keys! Of course, as always, there is a trade-off: it's much
easier to make mistakes and typos on the lighter switches.

All in all, I'm pretty happy with this one, and I'm using it to type
right now, just for some variety.
