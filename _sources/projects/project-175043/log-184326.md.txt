# Joystick
Published on 2020-10-01 in {ref}`project-175043`.

There is a conveniently large empty area smack in the middle of this
PCB, and it makes me have ideas. The most obvious one is to put a
display there â€” then not only I can see any messages or exceptions
from the CircuitPython code running on it, but I can also display
things. Or, like, have menus and settings. A library of Unicode
characters and emoticons. Fancy animations. Sky is the limit. But then
I would probably also want an external flash storage and a SAMD51
microcontroller with more memory, so I guess I will not do that.

Another thing I could put there is something that would let me not
have to take my hand off the keyboard to move the mouse. A trackball,
for example. Or a touchpad. Or, you know, one of those cheap tiny
joysticks they use in handheld consoles. That seems like a reasonable
idea, and I can always simply not populate those footprints if I
change my mind.

I also added a pair of tact switches on both sides, for the mouse
buttons. Still tempted to add an encoder wheel with a third button,
but I only have the kind that is mounted flat on the edge of the PCB,
and that doesn't work with this design.

I'm still considering adding a few LEDs on the free pins, for things
like CapsLock or layer switching indicators.

I'm also closer to actually ordering the board and the switches,
especially with the utter failure of the {ref}`project-174982` project, since that means I actually *need* this keyboard.
