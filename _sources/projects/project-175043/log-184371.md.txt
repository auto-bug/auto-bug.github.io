# DPI, How Does It Work?
Published on 2020-10-01 in {ref}`project-175043`.

After looking at the PCBs for {ref}`project-174982` a little bit closer, taking some measurements, and then checking the
gerbers and the design I realized that I have made a horrible mistake.
That keyboard is almost 10% larger than intended! And then I checked
the designs for Flatreus, and they have the same problem. No wonder
there seemed to be so much room.

Turns out that I have recently upgraded Inkscape and it has changed
the default DPI it uses to calculate units. Fritzing assumes the old
DPI, so all PCB outlines I imported were bigger than designed. And
then I placed all components within the outline, proportionally
spaced. Of course for something like a keyboard this won't work. So I
had to basically re-do the Atreus PCB from scratch.

It's more tightly packed now, of course. Also, the chip is no longer
at a 45Â° angle, as there is no room for that. On the other hand, I re-
arranged the pins a bit and added two more LEDs, for debugging and
status. There is still a joystick and two tact buttons for mouse
emulation.

I think this is good enough for now, so I have ordered that PCB.
