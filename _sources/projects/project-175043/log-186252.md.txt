# Scissors...
Published on 2020-11-20 in {ref}`project-175043`.

So this project is finished and works fine. But I recently found in my
drawer those Kailh scissor switches that I ordered a year ago to test,
and forgot about them. So why not test them by making another Atreus-
like keyboard? This switch of course has different footprint again,
and with a hole in the PCB too, so a new design for the PCB is called
for. And since I don't like to do the same thing twice, I removed the
column stagger this time, and only included two keys in the middle.

I will also need the special key caps for this. Kailh has some super-
ugly ones, but that will do for now, I suppose. As usual, the PCB is
ordered and should arrive within a week or two, then I can assemble it
all and try it.
