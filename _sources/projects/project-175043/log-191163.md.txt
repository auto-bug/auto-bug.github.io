# Small Improvements
Published on 2021-04-01 in {ref}`project-175043`.

I made some small improvements to the Flatreus recently. I replaced
the tact switches I originally used for the mouse buttons with actual
switches for a mouse. They require much less actuation force, and are
much more clicky. They feel exactly right, even though they are a bit
harder to reach due to being lower.

As you can see, I'm using leftover keycaps with it now. They fit
surprisingly well my new layout:

It was originally designed for a smaller keyboard, so 8 keys are
unused, but they were hard to reach anyways.
