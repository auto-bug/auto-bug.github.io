# Original Layout
Published on 2020-10-24 in {ref}`project-175043`.

Now that I have the project tested and working, I added the gerbers
and Fritzing design to the files, so that other can also build it. It
uses the bootloader and CircuitPython firmware for {ref}`project-171381` , and I added an example with the original Atreus layout to the ukeeb
library: [https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb/blob/main/examples/flatreus.py](https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb/blob/main/examples/flatreus.py)

Here's that layout, taken from the Atreus kickstarter page. Of course
you can easily modify it for your own tastes.
