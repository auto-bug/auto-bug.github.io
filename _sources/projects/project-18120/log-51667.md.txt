# Boards #5
Published on 2017-01-10 in {ref}`project-18120`.

The chain of stupid mistakes continues. The new boards arrived shortly
before Christmas, but I didn't have more HT16K33 chips to test them.
Today, after a month on the way, the chips finally arrived. Of course,
because I put the chip on the bottom layer this time, I mirrored the
footprint and all the pins are wrong. I soldered two boards before I
realized (because I wanted to make sure it's not a faulty chip). When
I realized it's the PCBs that are wrong, not the chips, I decided to
recover them. I don't have a hot air gun at home, so I went for the
hot-plate approach. First, I removed the plastic from the pin headers,
and desoldered each pin. Then I turned on my electric kitchen stove,
waited a bit until it became hot, placed a board chip-up on the plate,
and pulled with tweezers on the chip. At some point it just came off.
I repeated the same with the second board, and even got the SMD
resistors back.

Then it's back to the drawing board. I re-did all the connections the
correct way, and ordered the boards again. See you in a few weeks when
they arrive.

This was really supposed to be a short and simple project...
