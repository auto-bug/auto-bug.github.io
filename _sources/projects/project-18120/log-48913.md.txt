# Initial Prototype
Published on 2016-11-10 in {ref}`project-18120`.

So, [Adafruit has those nice 8x8 LED matrix backpacks](https://www.adafruit.com/categories/325) , which use IÂ²C for communication and are generally very cool to play
with. They even have shields (FeatherWings) for their boards with
them. However, in my workshops I'm using D1 Mini boards (mostly
because they are cheaper). I decided that it would be very nice to
have such a shield for the D1 Mini, so I decided to try to make one.

I started by ordering a HT16K33 breakout board, some loose chips in
the 20-pin packages, and a handful of those LED matrices. Once they
arrived, I assembled a prototype on the breadboard, to make sure I got
all the connections right:

Then I tested it with my [HT16K33 MicroPython library](https://github.com/adafruit/micropython-adafruit-ht16k33) . Turns out that the original backpacks are shifted by one column for
some reason, so that they start at column 1 and end at column 0
(instead of starting at 0 and ending at 7). Oh well, a quick fix, and
my shield is compatible.

Next, I need to design the actual PCB. To the Fritzing!

Maybe it's not the simplest thing to route, but it's not too horrible
either. I kept all parts on the same side (the chip goes under the
matrix), for ease of assembly. Unfortunately the board has to be
duble-layer -- there are just too many crossing traces. I wonder why
they didn't design those chips to match the matrix pinout better.

The board is exactly one inch by one inch, by the way -- would have
been a nice candidate for the one square inch contest.

Next, [to OSHPark to order the boards](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/AJvcKWub) , and now I'm just waiting for them to arrive. Should be here before
Christmas.
