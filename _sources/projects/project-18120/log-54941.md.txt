# Great Success
Published on 2017-03-15 in {ref}`project-18120`.

The last version of the PCBs arrived, and lo and behold: they work
perfectly fine! I even used the same chips and matrices that I
brutally desoldered from the previous prototypes -- and they work fine
too. That means I can make my order for the mass production!

Well, for some definition of mass. I have panelized the design to fit
4 boards in are of 5x5cm, to maximize the yield. A single order of 10
boards should give me 40 boards -- and that's how many I plan to make
for a start, ten of every color. I have ordered the chips and the
matrices already, so the PCBs will be the last component to arrive.
