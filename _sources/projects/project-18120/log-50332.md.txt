# Boards #4
Published on 2016-12-13 in {ref}`project-18120`.

My recent trouble with code for {ref}`project-13278`  made me think whether I actually didn't jump to conclusions too fast
with those HT16K33 chips. You know what they teach you: before you
blame the hardware, the compiler, the operating system or the
libraries, make sure that everything on your side is absolutely
spotless and correct. I thought I did. I was wrong.

Today I took the Adafruit HUZZAH Feather board, connected one of the
non-working matrix shields to its GPIO0 and GPIO2 pins (the ones that
have built-in pullups), uploaded my ht16k33_matrix module and tried
it, and... it worked. Just like that.

Of course the shields connect to pins GPIO4 and GPIO5 of the D1 Mini,
which do not have their own external pullups, so I have no choice but
to re-design the PCB again, this time to include footprints for a two
additional resistors:

I will of course "fix" the shields i already have, by simply soldering
the resistors straight to the pins -- so the good news is that I will
have a bunch of working shields. The bad news is I will have to wait a
couple of weeks more to test the new PCBs before I can officially
announce this project as working.
