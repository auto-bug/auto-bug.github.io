# Creeping Back to Life
Published on 2018-09-12 in {ref}`project-27853`.

Yes, this project spent quite a bit of time in a drawer. I got the
AMG8833 sensor to play with, but I didn't really have a good idea
about what I want to do with it. Then I designed this PCB with a
footprint for that sensor, an atmega and a LED matrix, hoping that
with enough magic I can make it into a kind of thermal camera. Then
the PCB arrived together with a bunch of other PCBs, and got put into
a drawer.

Fast forward a few months, and the {ref}`project-7813` is back. I looked through my projects, and noticed that hey, this PCB
is 2cm on a side to fit the LED matrix, and that's less than an inch,
so why not. So I submitted it to the contest and promptly forgot about
it.

Now the deadline is looming, and it would be nice to at least start on
this. So I took the PCB and soldered it up, and also found all the
components that I will need:

I used the female pin headers in the prototype so that I can remove
the led matrix. The final version will not have them, and the led
matrix will be soldered directly -- at least that's the plan.

There will also be a lipo battery in there.

Now I need to write the code for the atmega to handle the led matrix.
