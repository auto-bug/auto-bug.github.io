# Another Batch of PCBs

The last few weeks have been very busy, with all the conferences,
sickness, day job, etc. so I fell a little behind with my plan to have
regular experiments published here. Hopefully that will improve.

In the mean time, I ran out of boards for Tote (there are some people
wanting to build it, after all), so I ordered another batch from Dirty
PCBs. It's still version 4 of the boards, but there are some small
improvements:


 * the PCB is thinner, so it's lighter and leaves more room between the
servo horns and the screws,
 * there are more holes in it, which makes it even lighter, and hopefully
makes it easier to attach stuff,
 * the mounting holes are not metalized anymore, so harder to make a
short circuit,
 * the holes for the servo horns are slightly bigger, so the horns fit
easier.
