# PCB Design
Published on 2020-10-11 in {ref}`project-175326`.

As usual, everything starts with the PCB design.

Nothing fancy. The minimal SAMD21 schematic with USB, plus six keys
with diodes, a LED and a programming header. As usual in my projects
the header has staggered pins to allow plugging in a male header
without soldering.

The board will use choc switches, because I really like them. In
hindsight, I should have designed some kind of a frankenfootprint so
that any switch could be used â€” maybe I will do that in the next
version.
