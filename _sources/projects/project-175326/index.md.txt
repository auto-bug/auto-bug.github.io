Designing and building your own keyboards is great fun and usually
results in better keyboards than money can buy, but the fact that
mechanical switches are rather expensive and an average keyboard
contains a lot of them makes the prospect a little bit scary for
beginners. That's why I decided to make a "minimal viable prototype"
keyboard that demonstrates most of the challenges and lets you try
your skills without breaking the bank.

As you can see, there are only six keys. That means you probably won't
be able to type with it, unless you invent some aggressive chording
scheme, but you can use it for things like volume keys, switching
workspaces, switching keyboard layouts or dedicated arrow keys.

The board runs CircuitPython, so that it is easy to program it and to
explain how the programs work. Of course nothing stops anybody from
programming it in C or Arduino or anything else, it's just a regular
SAMD21 microcontroller.
