# Reuse
Published on 2018-08-21 in {ref}`project-160167`.

It's been a little bit frantic the last few days, and I didn't really
have much time to work on this project, but I decided to at least
write about what the plans are.

First of all, the "dumb" blinking barrette has been given to a number
of people for testing, so that I will know if this general size,
weight and attachment method are practical. I still have a few left, I
might put them on Tindie when I find a bit of time to make proper
photos and write the description.

Second, the "smart" barrette is supposed to run CircuitPython and have
a bunch of sensors built in — pretty much like the Adafruit's Circuit
Playground Express, except with a battery, a charger and some standard
of sockets for all the devices. So... why not just use the Circuit
Playground Express, and make a base board for it with the battery,
charger and the sockets, and the barrette, of course? That would save
me a lot of work and testing, and it would still look pretty
interesting. So that is the current plan. I found a nice round LiPo
battery, and I started to design the PCB for the base:

I still requires more work, of course — maybe when I have another
sleepless night.
