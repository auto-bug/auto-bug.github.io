# Hot Plate Soldering
Published on 2016-03-21 in {ref}`project-9769`.

The PCBs that I wrote about last time were not the real PCBs. OSHPark
has made a mistake in the board thickness (a new option that they
have), and sent me the boards again, this time thinner. I didn't
realize that, so I was quite surprised to see the second shipment, but
all is good.

The GY-61 breakout kit also arrived, so I'm ready to try and solder it
on that board. This is a "LFCSP LQ" surface-mount package, so
impossible to do with a hand soldering iron. At the hackaday channel
someone suggested using a kitchen stove, so I have that a try. First,
I tinned the board:

Then I covered it in flux, and went to the kitchen. I have an electric
stove with a glass top, so I put the board directly on it, and heated
it until the solder melted. Then I carefully placed the chip on the
right spot, and pressed it gently down. Finally, I removed the whole
thing from the stove.

Next, time for a test. I didn't want to solder an attiny85 on the
board just yet, because it's inconvenient to debug with it, so instead
I connected a 3.3V Pro Mini with some kynar wire:

Note that the VCC cable from USB2TTL is connected to the RAW pin, not
to the VCC pin on the FTDI header, because I don't want 5V on the VCC
pin...A quick sketch lets me verify that the thing works!


```cpp
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.print(analogRead(A0));
    Serial.print(", ");
    Serial.print(analogRead(A1));
    Serial.print(", ");
    Serial.print(analogRead(A2));
    Serial.println();
    delay(300);
}
```

Now I just need to figure out what are the center values when powered
with the battery I want, and write the program.
