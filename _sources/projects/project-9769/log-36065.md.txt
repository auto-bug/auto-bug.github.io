# Assembled, Programming
Published on 2016-04-16 in {ref}`project-9769`.

Since all my "current" projects are either waiting for parts, or being
punished for not going the way I wanted, I decided to finish this one.
I started with connecting all the wires to an ATTiny85 I have soldered
to a breakout board. Turns out that the accelerometer connected to the
chip's pins doesn't prevent it from being programmed! Yay, that means
I can just solder the chip in place and re-program it with a clip.

Next step, I made some connectors for the servo sockets, so that I can
use SoftwareSerial on them for debugging. In particular, I needed to
check what are the rangers on the accelerometer readings. Turns out
that "0" is smack in the middle of the range, at 512, and 1g is about
100 units. Good enough.

Next I will need to check the servo's limits (since I'm not using
exactly 50Hz for PWM, they will be different) and actually write the
code for the ears-moving logic... I guess for that last part, I will
still use the Pro Mini-based prototype. It's simply easier to
reprogram.
