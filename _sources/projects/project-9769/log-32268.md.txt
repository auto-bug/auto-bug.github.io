# Movement Test
Published on 2016-02-20 in {ref}`project-9769`.

I have the mechanical part ready, and I did a small test of the ears
movement. They move so slow because that's what the test does, not
because they are so slow -- in fact, they can move into a new position
quite fast.

On the control side, I gave up on the Pololu IMU, and instead went
with a simple GY-61 analog accelerometer. This should be more than
enough, since I only need to react to movements, and this is much
simpler to interface.
