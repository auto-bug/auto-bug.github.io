# Miniaturization
Published on 2016-02-21 in {ref}`project-9769`.

So I've been thinking... If I were to do it seriously, I would
probably drop the Pro Mini and use an ATtiny85 instead, with a custom,
small PCB to contain the whole thing. It would be small enough to
actually fit on the band holding the ears, something like this:

That's 23Ã—6.5mm, and could be made even smaller if I populated both
sides... Then of course the battery would need to go into one of the
ears, and there also needs to be a power switch...\
