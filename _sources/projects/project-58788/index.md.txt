# ESP8266 with True USB

Make it act as a USB disk and just copy files on it.

The ESP8266 (and ESP32) is a great chip: powerful, versatile, cheap,
easily obtainable. But it's a little bit fiddly when it comes to
programming the development boards and transferring the files onto and
from them. You have to install the drivers (good luck if you have a
mac), install the flasher software, get the flash parameters just
right, get the boot pin low (or make sure the auto-reset circuit
works), etc. Individually, each of those steps is easy. Together, they
make it hard to simply just start coding.

Wouldn't it be great if there was a development board that, instead of
the dumb USB to serial converter, would sport a small and cheap USB-
capable microcontroller, just like the Arduino UNO or Micro:bit, which
would let you simply copy files over to a USB drive it would expose?

That idea is not mine, of course, I heard it for the first time from [@tannewt](https://hackaday.io/hacker/194126) . But I really want this to happen.

However, I know almost nothing about USB, and this is very much a
research project. I expect extremely slow progress and possibly
shelving of this project later on. I believe it is possible to do what
I want (at least the filesystem and serial access), but I'm not sure I
have enough experience to pull it off.

All help is greatly appreciated!
