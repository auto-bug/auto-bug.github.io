# First PCB
Published on 2018-03-23 in {ref}`project-58788`.

I still didn't get the flash to work correctly, but I had some
sleepless night, so I sketched up a PCB for the first prototype. This
is the top where the ESP-12F module goes:

There is also an extra button on the opposite side than the reset, for
selecting the USB mode. That's pretty much it, since the Pro Mini
already hast he voltage regulator and all that, and the programming
pin can be held down by software.
