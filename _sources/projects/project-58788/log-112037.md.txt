# MassStorage Demo with LUFA
Published on 2018-03-08 in {ref}`project-58788`.

Today I experimented a little bit with the mass storage demo. I
created the Dataflash.h and flash command header files based on the
modified demo from  [https://github.com/JayconSystems/EPaper-Mass-Storage-Demo-LUFA](https://github.com/JayconSystems/EPaper-Mass-Storage-Demo-LUFA)  and I got it to compile. Then I changed the pins and the flash id to
fit my project. Flashed it and lo and behold — it enumerates!
Unfortunately, I was unable to write anything to the flash — I suspect
I need to provide the commands for this particular model of flash from
its datasheet. More debugging to come.

\
I also didn't try to use the USBtoSerial to actually flash the ESP8266
— I will do that later.
