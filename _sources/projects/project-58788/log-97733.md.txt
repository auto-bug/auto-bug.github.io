# Chip Candidates
Published on 2018-02-20 in {ref}`project-58788`.

I have been looking through the cheap microcontrollers with USB
support, and I have narrowed my list to two, with maybe possible
third.

The first candidate is the venerable ATmega32u4. It has been around
for a long time, there is a LUFA library for handling USB with some
examples for the MSC device, and I have a whole bunch of cheap Pro
Micro development boards I can experiment with. It also has a lot of
GPIO pins, so it could also be useful for projects like {ref}`project-26823`  for handling extra functions, like the buttons and backlight.

The second candidate is the SAMD11. Much more modern, cheap and comes
in an easy to solder package. It also requires fewer passives — I
think it can even work without the crystal. There is also a MSC device
example for in the ASF3 library. It is however more of an unknown for
me, as I have never before programmed any. I got a {ref}`project-10210`  board to experiment with it.

Finally, a distant third is the good old STM32F103 chip. It comes on
the "blue pill" dev boards, and it also has some MSC examples. I have
some limited experience programming it, too, so maybe it will turn out
to be easier than the other two.
