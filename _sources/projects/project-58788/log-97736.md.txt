# Collaboration
Published on 2018-02-20 in {ref}`project-58788`.

By the way, if you find this project interesting, I would very much
welcome collaboration. There is a lot of ground to cover, and a lot of
experimenting to do. This can be easily spread to more people, each
picking a different direction. And I also think that a lot of good
projects could branch from this.

Also, I have zero experience with programming anything USB-related, so
any help with that is appreciated too!
