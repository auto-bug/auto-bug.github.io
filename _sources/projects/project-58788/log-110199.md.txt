# USBtoSerial with LUFA
Published on 2018-03-05 in {ref}`project-58788`.

I didn't have much time this week, since I was travelling (and got
stuck in Dublin due to cancelled flights), but I did take a Pro Micro
with me for experimenting, and after some poking around the LUFA
project's directories, I found a ready to use USBtoSerial demo. It is
in fact very similar to the Arduino code I was trying to get to run
earlier, but this one comes with a specific version of the library
that it works with.

The project is in the Projects/USBtoSerial directory, and all you need
to change to make it work on the Pro Micro is the makefile — the usual
MCU, BOARD and F_CPU changes. Then make, objcopy to make a hex file,
and avrdude to flash it. And it seems to be working!

I didn't actually have a USB serial dongle to test it properly, but I
shorted TX and RX pins to get to test the echo, and that seems fine.
When I get back home I will try to program the ESP8266 with this, but
I don't expect any problems.

Next step is getting the mass storage demo to work with my own flash
chip — since the Leonardo board definition misses the header files for
flash, I will need to write those — hopefully I will be able to figure
them out from the files for other boards. When that works, I will need
to figure out how to make it look for the filesystem at an offset, and
what the offset is for MicroPython (or even better, how to find it).
