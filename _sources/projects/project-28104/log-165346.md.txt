# First Try
Published on 2019-07-04 in {ref}`project-28104`.

There is a battery shield for D1 Mini development board, produced and
sold by Wemos, but I find it a little lacking for some specific use
cases. It wastes power by boosting the battery voltage to 5V and then
letting the on-board LDO bring it back to 3.3V. It has a separate USB
socket for charging the battery. It doesn't have a power switch. And
most of all, it doesn't contain an actual battery — you have to
connect that separately. That means it not suitable for some really
small and portable projects. So I made this.

It's a very simple shield. It only has the battery itself, behind a
shottky diode to protect it from your USB power, a charging circuit
connected to the 5V pin, with an indicator diode, and a power switch.
That's it.\


There are two down-sides for using this design. First, the battery is
tiny — only around 40mAh — so it won't last long. Second, it only
provides between 3.6 and 4.2V to the 5V rail, so if you have anything
that actually requires 5V, it won't work. But I think it's still
useful for certain projects.
