# Second Try
Published on 2019-07-04 in {ref}`project-28104`.

I needed a battery for my {ref}`project-165983` , so I revived this project and tried a second attempt. This time I'm
using a bigger battery, LIR2450, though I made sure you can solder a
holder for the smaller LIR2032 as well. There has been a change in how
the charging works â€” with the switch on, the board is powered from the
battery (through a shottky diode, to protect it from USB power you
might have connected), with the switch off, the battery is charging.
