# First Animation
Published on 2023-09-13 in {ref}`project-192761`.

It took me a few days to decide on the style I want the image to be.
On one hand I want it to be a cute astronaut girl, but on the other
hand I want to keep it as simple as possible, so that I can animate it
easily, and so that it's recognizable from a distance. After some
experimenting with different techniques and programs, and looking at
different cartoons, I finally decided on a style that is inspired by
the Swiss Familienwagen decorations. It's very cartoonish and simple,
but stil pretty cute. I got the first, easiest animation done:
blinking.
