# Second Animation and Accelerometer
Published on 2023-09-30 in {ref}`project-192761`.

I had a little bit of time today, so I quickly made a second animation
for this badge:

I also added the code to read the raw x, y, and z values from the
accelerometer, and play this animation if the x component is greater
than 5000 – which basically means that the badge is tilted to the
left. Of course adding a similar animation for the right tilt is
trivial. I also want to make a "stunned" animation, to be displayed
after the board has been shaken – but to detect that I will need to
keep some previous values and calculate the variance.
