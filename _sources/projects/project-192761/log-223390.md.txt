# Missing Components
Published on 2023-09-19 in {ref}`project-192761`.

Today I finally added all the missing components: the resistor for the
backlight, the accelerometer with its i2c pull-ups, and the two red
LEDs on the gun, with their matching resistors as well. I was waiting
for the right sized resistors to arrive from LCSC, but they seem to be
stuck at the airport for the last three weeks, so I squeezed the
bigger resistors I have in those footprints instead. I also improved
the idle animation a bit, adding random eye movements and improving
the timing of the blinking:

Now I need to figure out how to process the data from the
accelerometer to make it detect the events that will trigger different
animations. And of course to draw all those different animations. It
will probably take a while.
