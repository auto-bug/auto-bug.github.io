# Encoders
Published on 2016-04-15 in {ref}`project-10533`.

The encoders arrived today, and I actually had to take a moment to
read about them to understand how they work. Those are EVQWKA
quadrature encoders, with an additional button activated by pressing
on the wheel -- which makes them perfect as an interface for all sorts
of menus or scrolling:

You can easily google for a datasheet for these, which will give you
all the dimensions and the pinout. But it doesn't say anything about
the protocol used. Turns out that the protocol is so standard, that
nobody even mentions it anymore in the datasheets.Inside of them there is a star-shaped contact, and two contacts that
touch the prongs of the star. When you rotate the wheel, the star
rotates too, and touches the two contacts. The order in which the
contacts are touched tells you the direction of rotation. That's it.
This particular model has one pring per "click", so you will get 10,
00, 01, 11 on rotation one way, and 01, 00, 10, 11 on rotation the
other way. You can easily detect those with the pin interrupts in
Arduino, but I choose to use a library from [http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html)

It works flawlessly. Now to program and assemble the whole thing...
