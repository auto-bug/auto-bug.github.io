    Once upon a time I found a Nokia display in my drawer, and figured out
I need to try to use it in a project. So I went and built the simplest
thing -- a small serial display, that I can connect to my robots for
debugging. That's how {ref}`project-7111`  was born. It is actually very useful, but a little bit cumbersome to
use. So I decided to try and improve the design a little bit.

Nano TTY is following the same idea -- a small screen that lets you
see the serial traffic from your project. However, there are some
improvements:


 * much smaller and lighter
 * high-contrast OLED display
 * fast, smooth scrolling, using a scroll wheel
 * large scroll buffer

There may be further improvements, depending on how well this goes,
but this is the minimum plan.
