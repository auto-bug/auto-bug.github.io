# Now Using PROGMEM
Published on 2015-11-09 in {ref}`project-7860`.

Thanks to [@davedarko](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459) 's persistence and his {ref}`project-8252`  project, there is now version of this song that keeps all the note
data in PROGMEM, and thus uses so little memory, that it runs on
ATTiny45. The updated code is in the repository linked on the left.
