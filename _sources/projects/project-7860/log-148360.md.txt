# Corrected Repositories
Published on 2018-06-24 in {ref}`project-7860`.

 [@Travis Hardiman ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/125739) pointed out that the code I have in the [repository](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/)  in the attiny10 branch is actually for attiny85, and the attiny10
code is missing, so I went ahead and re-created the attiny10 code
(which I must have lost somehow), this time on attiny9 (which is the
same as attiny10, only doesn't have ADC, which we don't need). It's in
the attiny9 branch now. So to summarize:


 * attiny85:  [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/) 
 * attiny10 and attiny9: [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny9/main/](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/) 
 * attiny13:  [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny13/main/](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/) 

Sorry for the confusion.

Also, to program the attiny10, you need to use a programmer capable of
programming with the TPI protocol — recent versions of USBASP support
it, you just need to add a 1kΩ resistor...
