# Nyan Boards in Singles (Actually Triplets)
Published on 2016-12-02 in {ref}`project-7860`.

So you want to try making your own Nyan Board, but you don't feel like
ordering 60 of them and waiting a month? Here's a link to OSHPark for
a version of the PCB with a single cat: [https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/HUWiMrKc](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/HUWiMrKc) 

For me the price is $3 for 3 boards, which sounds reasonable. And it
comes in any color you like, as long as it's purple.
