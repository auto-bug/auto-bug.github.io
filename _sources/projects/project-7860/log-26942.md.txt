# PCBs Are Here
Published on 2015-10-23 in {ref}`project-7860`.

So the PCBs arrived today. I must say that they look much smaller than
they looked in Fritzing. Right off the bat I can see two pretty bad
mistakes.

First, I made some connections between them at the last minute,
because [@davedarko](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459)  pointed out that DirtyPCBs don't accept disconnected boards. The
connections were some very small rectangles. I can see in the
fabricated boards that they were enlarged consireably -- probably to
make the whole thing more stable less prone to breaking on its own. Oh
well, I will just have to dremel them to the right shape.

Second, the top two cats have a different design for the eyes -- the
LEDs are on the back side, and there are holes through which they
should shine. Those holes should not be metalized, as they touch the
LED pads on both sides, and I designed them as non-metalized in
Fritzing. DirtyPCBs made them metalized anyways -- probably a because
they touched a pad and their software does that then. Oh well, some
more dremeling.

Other than that it looks good and I will start assembling them as soon
as I find where I misplaced my attiny85s, or the new batch that I
ordered arrives, whichever comes first.
