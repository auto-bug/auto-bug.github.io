# Boards Ordered
Published on 2015-09-27 in {ref}`project-7860`.

For a silly project, this has a lot of experimenting in it. I just
figured out how to panelize a board design in Fritzing such that I can
send it to DirtyPCBs. I managed to fit 6 nyan cats on a single 5Ã—5cm
board, so I should have about 60 of them when the boards arrive.

You can order yours too, if you like: [http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=11758&accesskey=87955192e4f12cde52
