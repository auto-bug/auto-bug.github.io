# ATtiny13
Published on 2016-12-21 in {ref}`project-7860`.

The ATtiny13 chips finally arrived, and I can test the code from the
"tiny13" branch on real hardware (find it at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny13](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny13) ). After some struggling with getting my USBASP programmer to work
with the chip (I needed a newer firmware and a -B option for avrdude
to slow the clock), I got it flashed and playing:

It's a bit too fast, but changing the clock definition in the Makefile
to 1200000 fixed that. The tone is probably wrong too, but I'm tone-
deaf, so I don't care.

The difference from the regular Nyan Board is that it uses Timer0
(because there is no Timer1 on ATtiny13), and a different pin for the
speaker. If you look at the six cats on the PCB, you will see that one
is slightly different -- that's the ATtiny13 version.

I still have one more chip to try for the Nyan Board, but that is
going to be a surprise.
