# Tabulate your Data
Published on 2016-11-26 in {ref}`project-7860`.

So I tried to shrink this program even more. There are those two
lookup tables in there, one with frequencies of the notes and one with
octaves. By sorting the notes and replacing the frequencies with a
simple formula (Wolfram Alpha helped me to come up with it), I got:


```python
120 + (354 + a * 6363 + a * a * 293) // 1000
```

Very happy with it, I put it in my program. BAM! 500 bytes larger.Why? Well, I blame 16-bit division and modulo that i had to use...\
