# Doing Useful Work
Published on 2016-01-06 in {ref}`project-7860`.

Some of the comments here and on [HaD.com](http://HaD.com)  suggested, that this project is pretty much useless, apart from its

there. Behold:

This is a Nyan Cat connected to the door unlocking mechanism in [MechArtLab in ZÃ¼rich](http://wiki.sgmk-ssam.ch/index.php/MechArtLab) . Thanks to [@Tillo](https://hackaday.io/hacker/89577)  for setting it up and letting me know!
