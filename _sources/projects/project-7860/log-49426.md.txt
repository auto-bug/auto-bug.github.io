# Efficient Tone
Published on 2016-11-23 in {ref}`project-7860`.

One change that I will need to do this time will be to completely
rewrite the tone-generating function. Originally, I just used whatever
was available in the Arduino core that I used -- and that turns out to
be quite a bit of code. Way over the 1k limit.

But hey, generating a PWM signal at a specified frequency while the
microcontroller doesn't have anything else to do is not rocket
science, right? Even if I completely fail to understand the timers, in
the worst case I can just have a bunch of empty loops spinning there,
busy-waiting for the right moment to flip the pin.

I didn't have much time today to do any actual experiments with the
ATtiny85, but I did find an interesting article about a technique,
that will maybe let me do a much better thing than a square wave: [http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN](http://www.technoblogy.com/show?QVN)
