# Faulty Parts
Published on 2016-12-02 in {ref}`project-7860`.

I assembled the first of the new Nyan Boards. It could be programmed,
but it didn't do anything. I spent an hour debugging all the
connections and checking connectivity on an unpopulated board and all
that -- nothing. So I assembled a second one. It couldn't even be
programmed. So I removed the chip from it and tried another. Same.
Then another. That one worked.

I think that keeping my attinys loose at the bottom of the drawer
might have been a mistake.

(Oh, and I used yellow LEDs, because the green ones didn't arrive
yet.)
