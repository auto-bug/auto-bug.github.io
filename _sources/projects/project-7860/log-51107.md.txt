# ATtiny10 Board
Published on 2017-01-01 in {ref}`project-7860`.

I'm still waiting for this board to ship from OSHPark, but since I
tested the code with the chip already, I'm quite confident it will
work just fine. Since it will probably not get here before the
contest, I will share the order link here: [https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/CWLBdY8g](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/CWLBdY8g)
