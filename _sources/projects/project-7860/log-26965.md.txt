# Great Success
Published on 2015-10-23 in {ref}`project-7860`.

I have the first cat working. For some reason my program suddenly
stopped working, and nothing helped until I switched to a different
Arduino core... I swear it worked before, so no idea what is going on
there. Anyways, after some trial-and-error, desoldering, resoldering,
reprogramming, etc. I finally got it to work how I wanted. Behold:

A little underwhelming, I know, but still fun. In the coming days I
will prepare proper build instructions and will send the boards to
people, who have requested one.
