# Vertical Climb

A small robot walking around your desk or even around your room on the
floor is one thing. The same robot climbing your furniture and able to
get everywhere in your room is a completely different game! That's why
I always wanted to make Tote able to climb. Unfortunately, the problem
is harder than it seems at first sight.

One way of doing it is by using magnets on the feet. It limits you to
metal surfaces, but that's a start. Today the magnets I ordered for
that purpose finally arrived, so I was able to do some experiments.
Unfortunately, the results are not very encouraging.

First, I attached the magnets to the robot. I figured that I want to
maximize the traction, while minimizing the force needed to actually
un-stick the leg, so I went for small flat magnets, and I wrapped them
into rubber from a balloon, then tied that to each leg.

Since the magnets seemed to be small and weak, I used two of them on
every foot initially. The effect wasn't very good -- they turned out
to be too strong, and Tote couldn't lift any of its feet:

Fine, let's try with fewer magnets then. That turned out to be just
strong enough to hold the robot when all four feet are touching the
metal surface, but not strong enough when on of the feet is raised:

Oh well, nobody said it will be easy. Back to the drawing board now.
Maybe I will try to climb a net next time?
