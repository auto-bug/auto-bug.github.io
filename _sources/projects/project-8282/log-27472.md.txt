# Case
Published on 2015-11-02 in {ref}`project-8282`.

While naked keyboard does have its appeal, it's time to build a case
for this baby. I started by cutting out the holes for the keys in the
face plate of depron:

They are not perfect -- laser cutter would do them better -- but
beggars can't be choosers. Next, I glued strips of depron around the
edges, placed my keyboard on them, and glued some more layers of
strips of depron. Finally, a large white sheet glued lightly at the
bottom:

(The keyboard is pink because of the protective foil on it.) Some
screws help to keep it all together. Next, I cut around the edges with
scroll saw, to get all those layers to exactly same shape. Then I
replaced the screws, cut their ends, added rubber feet  and voila:

After some testing, I decided that I will have to lower the front edge
a little -- by cutting the whole keyboard into a wedge shape. But
that's for tomorrow, as I won't be using power tools at night, waking
up the neighbours.
