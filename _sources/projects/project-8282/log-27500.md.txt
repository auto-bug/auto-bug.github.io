# Resources for Keyboard Makers
Published on 2015-11-03 in {ref}`project-8282`.

So, I guess I caught the bug, and I will be making another keyboard,
this time completely from scratch. This time I'm going to carefully
pick the switches, design the layout, have the case laser-cut, etc.
And that means, I will need these tools:


 *  [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) 
 *  [Keyboard Plate and Case Generator](http://builder.swillkb.com/) 
 *  [Keyboard Firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard)
