# Connections and Software
Published on 2015-12-22 in {ref}`project-8282`.

So today I finished the second version of Alpen Clack -- this one
built from scratch. As always, the most work-intensive part was
soldering everything together. This time I used non-insulated wire,
and added some kapton tape where it might touch anything -- this was
much faster than removing the insulation from wires for soldering. The
finished connections, before closing the keyboard:

Next comes the programming. I used the same firmware as for version
one, except this time I had 6 columns and 17 rows (I kept the layout
rotated 90Â°, as this is much easier to fit in 80 columns of source
code). I also drilled a small hole for the reset button, to be able to
press it with a pin.

Defining the layout was much easier this time, because of the saner
matrix -- the Pololu A* Mini has enough pins broken out for me to not
care so much about saving them. Still, I miscalculated a little bit
and had to use one of the LED pins. That still left me two LEDs for
CapsLock and ScrollLock (no NumLock), so it's fine.

Once everything was ready, I spent the customary 4 hours tearing my
hair off and staring at the code, trying to debug a problem with it.
In the end, it turned out that the compiler was caching a little more
than it should, and recompiling everything from scratch solved it.
