I fixed the switches in place with a little bit of glue (they can
still be removed if needed), and I soldered the horizontal connections
with a thick copper wire. Then I drilled the mounting holes for the A*
board, and secured it in place with screws. I also drilled the hole
for the USB cable, cut the plug from it, passed it through the hole
and re-soldered a "naked" plug back. The board is mounted above the
arrow keys in such a way, that you can see the LEDs on it -- I will
use those for CapsLock and so on. Finally, I taped the metal back-
plate with some transparent tape, so that there are no shorts, and
screwed it to the back -- to make sure everything fits properly. The
keyboard got much sturdier now, and I think it won't need additional
enforcing.

Next step is soldering the SMD diodes and the vertical columns, then
connecting it all to the board, and modifying the firmware for this
particular layout. It's almost finished.
