# Switches and Keycaps
Published on 2015-12-17 in {ref}`project-8282`.

The Gateron switches and the keycaps that I ordered on Massdrop
finally arrived. The switches fit nicely:

And the with the keycaps:

I still have two problems to solve, though. First, while the switches
fit, they are not particularry well kept in place by their snaps,
which apparently are designed for a thinner board. I will need to hold
them in place with something. Second, the acrylic sheet on which they
sit is really flimsy. I will either need to find something more
robust, or have them touch the back plate for stability. We will see
how it develops.
