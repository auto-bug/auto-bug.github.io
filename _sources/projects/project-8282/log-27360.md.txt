# Butchering
Published on 2015-10-30 in {ref}`project-8282`.

First I need to disassemble the whole keyboard, then I will pick the
parts I want to keep and modify it, and then put it back together
again. Sounds simple. Let's start with the switches. They are actually
just inserted in the holes in that metal plate, and then soldered to
the printed circuit board on the other side.

I briefly considered reusing the printed circuit board too, but it's a
single-layer board with insanely complex paths, and I really don't
feel like reverse engineering this. I will just connect everything
with wires instead.

So, the keycaps are removed and washed:

And then put out to dry:

The switches need to be unsoldered and removed one by one:

Then the PCB can be removed. I will probably also use all the diodes
that are on it:

Next, I need to cut the metal plate. First, just cut off the numpad
part:

Then, a bit of a complication. You see, modern keyboards have more
keys than the old ones had. In particular, they have the "Super" keys
between the "Ctrl" and "Alt". I want to have those too. Fortunately I
have some spare switches and keycaps from the numpad, so I will just
have to make additional holes for them.First, drill around the edge:

And then file the remains:

It's not super-pretty, mostly because that metal plate turns out to be
surprisingly hard. Steel? Perhaps.Finally, the finished layout:

Next, electronics and chassis.
