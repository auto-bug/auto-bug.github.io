# Version 1.2
Published on 2020-06-14 in {ref}`project-171381`.

The PCBs for version 1.2 arrived from [@oshpark ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) now, and even though the version 1.3 will arrive tomorrow, I decided
to assemble and test it. I used the nice clear soldermask on black FR4
option for the first time, and it does look pretty nice.

The fix was simple enough, and now the SPI pins are correct and
working. The next version will get rid of the micro-USB socket, and
use a PCB socket for USB-C — we will see tomorrow how well that works.
