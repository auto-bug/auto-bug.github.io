# Pinout
Published on 2020-07-25 in {ref}`project-171381`.

To actually do something with a board, it's good to know which pin
does what. The Feather standard already defines the functions of some
pins, but they can do so much more. So here is a pinout with the most
useful pin functions documented:

Initially I tried to figure it all out from the datasheet, but I
quickly noticed it's non-trivial. Some timers and some sercoms are
used internally by CircuitPython, and some are not available in the
version of the chip I'm using. So instead I decided to take a brute
force approach, and wrote a simple program that just tries all the
possible combinations.\


However, when it came to PWM, I simply gave up. The number of
combinations is huge, especially since order of creating the PWM
outputs matters, so I'm simply just marking which pins can have PWM at
all. It's up to the user to check if the particular combination of
pins they want to use for PWM is viable. I simply can't think of a way
to present this information clearly in a graphical way.
