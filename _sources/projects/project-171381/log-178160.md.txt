# Oops!
Published on 2020-05-26 in {ref}`project-171381`.

Would you believe me if I told you that I made a pretty stupid (and
easily avoided) mistake in this design? If you have followed any of my
previous projects, this should be an obvious thing to you. Of course I
made a stupid mistake, that's how I work after all! And you would be
completely right! Here is a fragment of the schematic that I posted
earlier, with one little detail marked in red. Does it strike it as
somewhat odd, perhaps?

Yes, I swapped MISO and SCK pins. No, any FeatherWing that uses SPI
will not work with Fluff M0 v1.0 because of that. Sorry to anyone who
used my gerbers. What can be done about it? Well, those are the tracks
in real life:

What can you do when your project has a mistake like that? There is
only one thing left to do: scrape it. With a sharp knife. Like this:

(Sorry for potatocam.) And then you solder some thin wires to it, like
this:

And then you fix the firmware and the gerbers:

It's a bit sad, because it's actually easier to route the correct
pins. Oh well. In any case, version 1.1 is here:
