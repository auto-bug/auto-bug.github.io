The PCBs arrived after their 3-week trip around the Europe, and as
usual I assembled and tested one. The good news is that it works very
well with any USB-A to USB-C cable. The plug is a bit wobbly, because
there is no metal sleeve to stabilize it, but it doesn't disconnect or
otherwise cause problems. The CNC router was even precise enough to
mill the small teeth on the sides of the socket, so it goes in with a
slight click. I'm pretty happy with that.\


The bad news is that it completely fails to work when connected to an
actual USB-C socket with a proper USB-C cable. It simply doesn't
receive any power. A little bit of research easily explains why: I
didn't add pull-downs on the CC1 and CC2 pins, because I thought it's
only needed for OTG devices. Turns out that the wording is a bit
confusing, and it's required to have those resistors for USB 2.0
device to receive any power from an USB-C port.

That means there will be version 1.4 of the board, and it means the
parts count also raises — I need to squeeze 2 more resistors in there.
I could probably get away with just one resistor — only one of CC1 or
CC2 is ever connected — but I will make room for two, and use a bodge
wire to see if it works also with one — I will need fewer prototypes
that way.\
