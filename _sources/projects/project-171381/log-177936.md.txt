# Assembled and Flashed
Published on 2020-05-22 in {ref}`project-171381`.

Since today is a holiday for me, I had the time to immediately
assemble of Fluff M0 and flash it with the bootloader and
CircuitPython. Since all pins, including the SWD and SWC are broken
out, flashing is simple:

You just have to connect 3V to VCC, GND to GND, SCK to SWC and MISO to
SWD. Then a couple of terminal commands:


```makefile
$ JLinkExe -if SWD -device ATSAMD21E18 -speed 4000kHz

And the bootloader is flashed. Now the FLUFFBOOT disk appears, and we
can drag the CircuitPython UF2 file to it. Done.
