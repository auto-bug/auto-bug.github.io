# Version 1.5
Published on 2020-07-22 in {ref}`project-171381`.

The PCBs for the micro-USB version arrived:

Some notes:


 * The connector works. Yay.
 * It's a little bit tight thickness-wise. More on that below.
 * I made it a little too deep â€” I can make it about 1.5mm smaller.
 * It's strong, even with the vias all lined up like that (later version
has the vias more spread). It shouldn't break off.
 * There is a bit of sideways wobble possible, but it doesn't seem to
cause any connection problems.
 * The width of the cutout is just right.
 * The pad on the top of the connector, that was supposed to connect to
the shield, is useless, and can cause a short if the plug is inserted
wrong way around.
 * I'm happy with the prototyping areas, I'm going to leave them like
that.
 * The connector doesn't necessarily look like an USB connector, so I'm
going to add a label to it describing it as such.
 * The staggering of the contacts, so that power gets connected before
the signals, is superfluous, because they are already staggered in the
plug. I will remove that.

Now, speaking about the thickness of the connector, it seems to be on
the edge of acceptable. The first insertion requires a bit of force
and leaves marks on the contacts:

This seems to be mostly to the thickness added by the HASL process of
coating the contacts with solder. I hope that removing the pad from
the other side will improve the situation here.

Speaking of the board thickness, I also made some 0.8mm PCBs for the
USB-C version, and it does sit in the plug much better, while still
not being too tight, so that is the preferred thickness for that kind
of connector for me.
