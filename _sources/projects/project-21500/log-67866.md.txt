# Finally
Published on 2017-09-27 in {ref}`project-21500`.

So the PCBs from DirttyPCBs never arrived. They made me wait for them
for 8 weeks, and then sent a replacement, which also never arrived.
After further 4 weeks of waiting, I thanked them, closed the support
ticket, and ordered the PCBs at Seeed Studio. Whatever new shipping
method they have now, it doesn't seem to be working in my country very
well. I don't think I will be ordering from them anymore.

On the bright side, the PCBs from Seeed just arrived, and I have
assembled and tested one, so they should appear in the Tindie store
very soon (I just need some time to assemble and test a bunch).
