# Waiting for the PCBs
Published on 2017-07-08 in {ref}`project-21500`.

The chips have already arrived, the Tindie page is prepared, now I'm
just waiting for the PCBs to arrive. It's been over 6 weeks already,
and I'm starting to get nervous about them. Dirty PCBs never took that
long before, except for that time around the Spring Festival, of
course, but that's expected.
