# That Was Quick
Published on 2017-05-28 in {ref}`project-21500`.

At last a project that went smoothly for a change. The MAX1238 chips
arrived, and I soldered them to the PCBs and they seem to be working
just fine at first sight. I was a bit worried about the chips being
too small when I saw them, but they are fine.

I wrote a very simple MicroPython library to handle this shield:


```python
class MAX123x:
    def __init__(self, i2c, address=0x35):
        self.i2c = i2c
        self.address = address
        self.reset()

    def reset(self):
        self.i2c.writeto(self.address, b'\x80')

    def read(self, channel):
        if not 0 <= channel <= 11:
            raise ValueError()
        data = self.i2c.readfrom_mem(self.address, 0x61 | (channel << 1), 2)
        return ((data[0] & 0x0f) << 8) | data[1]
```
