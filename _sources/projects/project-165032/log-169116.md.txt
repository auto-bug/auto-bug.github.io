# A Quick Fit Test
Published on 2019-09-23 in {ref}`project-165032`.

The prototype has arrived today, but I only had time to do a quick
test during my lunch break. I will assemble it properly later. Note
that the protective foil is not removed from the acrylic parts, so
they look non-transparent.

So far so good.
