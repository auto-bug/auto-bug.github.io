# The Curse of the OLED Display 3
Published on 2019-04-24 in {ref}`project-165032`.

This is not my first encounter with those small OLED display modules.
We actually go back a while.

First I tried to use it for the {ref}`project-27757` project, and I kept failing to get it working so much, that in the
final version I decided to just use one of the ready modules. And of
course after I did that and redesigned everything, I came back to the
initial project and discovered that the [display itself was physically faulty](https://hackaday.io/project/27757-microboy/log/71654-after-all-it-works) . But the project moved on, and I discovered other reasons why it
won't work (not enough memory and code space on the micro:bit for the
kind of games I wanted).

Second attempt was with the {ref}`project-100853` , where one of the prototypes I've build used that display. I used the
same display module, but in 4-wire SPI configuration this time. [I wasn't able to get it to work](https://hackaday.io/project/100853-circuitpython-badge/log/142400-mark-ii) , and I've moved on to e-ink displays, and later, after rethinking the
whole thing, to LED matrices, because of the specifics of the project
(the display needed to be big, not necessarily high-res).

And here I am again, with the accursed display, in 4-wire SPI mode
again. And again, I looked at the application notes in the datasheets
both for SSD1306 and for SH1106, [I looked at Adafruit's schematics for their breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/downloads) , and I am none the wiser. The connections are exactly the same as on
that badge, and there is really nothing wrong with them, at least as
far as I can see. Sure, all three sources of data use wildly different
values for the capacitors — from 1µF, through 2.2µF, up to 4.7µF and
10µF. So which ones are correct? Who knows? Will the display work with
my new PCB, if it didn't with the old one? Will I ever be able to get
those things to work?

Facing all those questions and doubts, I decided to take arms against
them, and answer them once and for all. I dug out of my drawers the
failed badge prototype, and decided to try and get it to work. I
started by finding the designs files for it, and re-creating the board
definition for CircuitPython, so that I can use the latest version (it
includes displayio module, which I will need to get to work with those
OLED displays later on). Then I flashed it, and dug up some of my old
libraries for MicroPython for this display, and quickly converted it
to CircuitPython. A quick test, and of course it doesn't work. Dead.

Fine, as a next step, I tried all three combinations of capacitor
values. No difference. Measured the voltages on those caps — hmm,
looks like the charge pump is not even starting...

I de-soldered the display from the prototype, and from a known good
breakout, and swapped them. Tried the breakout module with an Adafruit
board I had lying around, using Adafruit's SSD1306 libraries. Ah-ha!
The display did start, but it's an SH1106, not SSD1306. But it's not
faulty, so it should be at least showing something, like in this
breakout. Why doesn't it?

Next I tried the display from the known-good breakout in the
prototype, with the code I had on it. Nope, doesn't work. And I'm sure
this one is an SSD1306 and working. So something is wrong with the
prototype. The charge pump is not switching on, so perhaps something
with communications?

I checked the continuity for all the control pins — everything looks
correct. I re-soldered them, just to be sure. Still nothing. It seems
that physically everything is fine...

Wait a minute, what if I used those Adafruit libraries on this
prototype? I copied them over and lo and behold! The display works! It
was my crappy code all this time!

I re-soldered all the displays back to their places, and changed the
init sequence to a [minimal example from my tutorial](https://hackaday.io/page/5722-driving-oled-displays-directly)  — just enabling the charge pump and setting contrast.

And it works perfectly fine (the pattern on the display is the refresh
of the OLED interfering with my potato camera).

That means not only that the PCBs I ordered are going to work, but
also that I can already start testing code on this prototype.
