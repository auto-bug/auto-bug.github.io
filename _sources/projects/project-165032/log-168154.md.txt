# Playing with Glue
Published on 2019-09-02 in {ref}`project-165032`.

Since I still have a couple of the laser-cut parts left from prototype
3, I decided to make a simple experiment to see how bad they would
look like if I simply glued them together with instant glue. Here are
two attempts:

The first is using gelled glue, and applying only a little bit of it
on the middle layer, then pressing the two layers together. The second
is using liquid glue, covering the whole middle layer with it
generously, and then pressing the layers together.

I think the first one is completely unacceptable. The second one looks
better (the glue traces that are visible are actually not from the
glue in between the layers, but my fingerprints from handling the part
with dirty fingers). A huge problem with the second one, however, is
the excess glue that accumulated in the corners.

Unless there is a special way of doing this on industrial scale, for
example with some special machine, I don't think this is a viable
direction.
