# HeroFest
Published on 2019-11-21 in {ref}`project-165032`.

 [@Christian WaltherÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/94159) and me are going to have a table tomorrow (2019-11-22) in Bern
(Switzerland) at the HeroFest event, as a part of the Training Grounds
there. I will have a whole bag of different PewPews and various
prototypes, so if you are around and want to see how they look like,
and maybe chat a bit about them, then you should come.

I'm hoping that I can get some game developers and future game
developers interested in this.
