# Silkscreen
Published on 2019-07-28 in {ref}`project-165032`.

The microcontrollers should arrive on Monday, but since I had some
time today, I decided to work a little bit on the graphical side of
this. After all, we want it to look appealing. So I sat down with
Inkscape and prepared this silkscreen for the front:

I will need to move that via for the "z" button. The buttons are
labelled "o" for "accept/select", "x" for "reject/back", "s" for
"start" and "z" for "pause". As usual, I spent about 15 minutes
drawing it, and then another 30 fiddling with the nodes, trying to
work around Fritzing's gerber rendering bugs. Also, had to rotate the
actual PCB image up-side down, and then rotate it back in Fritzing â€”
for some reason that fixes it. Don't ask.
