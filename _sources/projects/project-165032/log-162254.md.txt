# PCB Ordered
Published on 2019-04-22 in {ref}`project-165032`.

A few more hours finishing the display circuit (oh boy, does the
SSD1306 datasheet suck in terms of example application), a bunch of
capacitors added, and I think it's ready. Oops, a small DRC fail
because I changed the USB connector. No problem, we will move that
trace, thank you DRC! And now ordered from OSHPark.

We will see how that goes. Now I we can bet on what comes first: the
buttons, the display, or the PCB?
