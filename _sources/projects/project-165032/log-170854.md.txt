# Schematic
Published on 2019-11-12 in {ref}`project-165032`.

Documentation is the hard part, not only because it's difficult to
clearly describe everything, but also because it's hard to find the
motivation. For instance, I never really needed a schematic for this
device, since most connections are really straightforward, and obvious
to me â€” but probably not to other people. So I have finally cleaned up
the schematic view.

There isn't much in it, but it might help when you are trying to
figure out what is connected where.
