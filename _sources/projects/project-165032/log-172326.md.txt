# Microsoft MakeCode Arcade
Published on 2019-12-26 in {ref}`project-165032`.

While designing this, I kept my eye on the [MakeCode Arcade specifications](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/adding)  to make sure the device could also be used with that platform. But I
never really took the time to test it. Today I finally decided to see
if it will work.

I updated the bootloader configuration to include information about
all the buttons on the device, and I picked one of the examples to
run. And lo and behold, it works:

After such a meticulous and throughout test, I decided it's time to
add it officially, so I made a pull request to the uf2-samdx1
repository to add the bootloader configuration there (and had to sign
a CLA, thank you Microsoft), and also I dropped the Arcade staff an
e-mail asking for adding it to the website. We will see what they
think about it.
