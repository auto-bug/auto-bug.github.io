# All the Buttons
Published on 2019-09-21 in {ref}`project-165032`.

While [@Elecrow ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848) is taking their time with the order (still in production after 10
days), all the buttons arrived for testing. I really like the idea of
laser-cut button caps, but if that doesn't work, I want to have some
other options, so testing continues. The buttons look like this:

From the left: the original 6x6x6 button I used in PewPew, the silicon
switch I used in µGame, those horrible 4x4 switches that dig into your
fingers, low-profile 6x6x5.5 switch, and ALPS SKRAAME010.

In the back you can see one of the cases I experimented with, with two
layers, bottom 2.5mm and top 1mm.

Some immediate conclusions: the metal one will need keycaps one way or
the other. The two low-profile buttons might work without (especially
the ALPS, that has silicone cap), but seem a bit narrow. The ALPS
button is minimally higher than then 2.5mm required to fit under the
top layer.

I will need to wait for the prototype to be able to say anything more.

case, one of the oldest homebrew consoles out there, the Arduboy:

Some interesting things to note here: they have brass nuts sunken in
the plastic for the bolts — that probably makes it impossible to crack
like it did for me. Buttons use plastic caps, but underneath are just
simple metal domes, glued to the PCB with a sticker, not even
soldered. The USB port is interesting as well, because it's sunk into
the PCB's cutout.

The other side is mostly a super-thin LiPo battery, with horrible
soldering, and a piezo stuck under it. Kapton tape guards against
shorts to the metal back.
