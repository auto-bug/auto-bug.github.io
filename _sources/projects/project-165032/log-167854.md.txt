Published on 2019-08-27 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I'm still waiting for the order from [@Elecrow ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848)  — it's taking longer than normal, probably because of the non-
standard 1mm acrylic. In the mean time, I decided to work a little bit
on the assembly instructions for the manual. I could make a rendering
in OpenSCAD or FreeCAD, or even in Blender, but in my experience
rendering are never as clean as pictures — they have too many
irrelevant details. So I decided to just draw it all in Inkscape,
using Fritzing's SVG exports and the cool features Inkscape has for
the isometric view. Here's the result:

The colors are artificial, to make the drawing easier to parse — in
reality all the parts are either white, black or transparent. The
wires for the piezo speaker are also too long — but that was the only
way to show how they have to pass through the hole in the middle part
of the case.
