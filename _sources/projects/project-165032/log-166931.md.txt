# Bootloader
Published on 2019-08-11 in {ref}`project-165032`.

As I wrote before, first tests have been done with the ItsyBitsy M4
bootloader, but eventually I want to have my own. Especially since
that is required for the [Make Code Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/)  compatibility. Fortunately there are some [very detailed instructions on how to configure and compile your own](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/adding) . There is a [pretty ingenious configuration system](https://github.com/Microsoft/uf2/blob/master/cf2.md)  embedded into the bootloader itself, which lets the code figure out
automatically which pins to use for the display, buttons, etc.

So I have a rudimentary bootloader working, but I need to play with
the different options a little bit more:
