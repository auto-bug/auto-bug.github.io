# Laser-cut Buttons Done
Published on 2019-10-29 in {ref}`project-165032`.

The new front plate and button caps arrived, and I'm happy with them.
I don't think I can improve this technique further, so I'm going to
leave it like this. The only other improvement I can think of right
now is to use switches that require less force for pressing â€” I will
be looking into availability of such switches, so far I didn't get any
answer to my inquiries.

I will still experiment with a plastic d-pad and buttons from the
NDSL, but I'm not even sure I want to go that way.
