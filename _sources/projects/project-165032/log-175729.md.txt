# Video Assembly Instructions
Published on 2020-04-09 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I should have recorded instructions on how to assemble (and also on
how to use, but that's a deeper subject) the PewPew M4 a long time
ago, but I never found the motivation to setup everything properly and
record it. That's why I am very happy to see that [@MakerfabsÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/268569) went and did the work for me instead! Not only the video is much
better quality than I would ever manage to make, but it also features
an awesome tattoo!
