(Top one is an old one, bottom one is the new one.) While they should
be compatible, and the flex connector ends at the same length, the
plastic enclosure of the display is a bit shorter. Which is fine by
me, because that means it won't be close to the edge of the PCB. But
will the new display work as well as the old one? I quickly soldered
one to one of the version 3 prototypes to test:

Seems to be perfectly fine. They also come with a much better adhesive
tape on the back, so maybe a version without the case will be actually
viable for them.

In other news, the PCB and laser-cut pieces for the version 4 are on
their way from [@ElecrowÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848) already:

Can't wait to see how they fit together.
