# Version 4 Ordered
Published on 2019-08-19 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I just made the final fixes for the next version: moved the "z" button
closer to the "o" and "x" buttons, made contacts and cutout for the
piezo speaker (and a resistor for it), added a footprint for a voltage
regulator. I also increased the sizes for the button holes so they
should be easier to fit now, and moved the display minimally further
from the edge, to make sure the flex tape doesn't stick out. Oh, and
made a cutout for the USB port in the top plate, as it's slightly
thicker than 2.5mm, and I don't feel like filling it down to size.
Also added labels for tx/rx pins on the back, and made the screw holes
in the inner plate smaller, so they will also be caught by the screws
â€” to compensate for the thinner top plater.

I specified the top plate to be 1mm thick, we will see if they follow
the instructions.

Everything else remains pretty much as it was.
