# Solderable Nuts
Published on 2019-09-21 in {ref}`project-165032`.

Here's an interesting part:

It's a bolt nut, which can be soldered into a hole on a PCB. The one
on the photo is particularly interesting, because it's exactly 2.5mm
high — same as the middle layer of my laser-cut acrylic case.

If I used those in places where I now use screws, there are several
advantages. First of all, I use bolts, which are not self-tapping, can
be screwed in and out practically infinite number of times, and don't
put additional sideways stress on the top layer of the acrylic.
Second, if I moved the holes a bit, and maybe added a few more around
the buttons, I could get rid of the middle layer entirely — just have
empty space there. That would halve the cost of the case.
