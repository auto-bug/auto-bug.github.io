# Footprint
Published on 2019-07-30 in {ref}`project-165032`.

The chips have arrived today, as predicted. And guess what! The
footprint is wrong!

Turns out that the fact that it's called QFN48 doesn't mean that the
pins will be spaced 0.4mm, like in the case of the ISSI chips I made a
footprint for before (and re-used here), and not, say, 0.5mm like in
the case of the SAMD51. Of course I should have checked the datasheet,
but who does that?\

In any case, ten minutes of Inkscape and I have a new footprint,
hopefully better fitting. I also made the pads much longer, to make
soldering by hand easier. Of course it's different size, so I had to
re-arrange all the traces — but it's now much better centered, and the
capacitors are aligned with the buttons, so I'm happy with it.

I was ordering a PCB for a different project already, with fast
shipping, so I threw this into the order — hopefully I will have it
next week.

In the mean time I can test firmware without the extra flash on the
ItsyBitsy M4, simply ignoring the fact that it has the extra flash.
And if I add a display module, I can also test the display speed. But
that's not today.
