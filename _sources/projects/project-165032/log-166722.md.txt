# Pew Library for TFT
Published on 2019-08-07 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I also finally tested how the displayio-based Pew library works on the
SAMD51, and it's much better than on the SAMD21, though you can still
see a lot of tearing. I still need to try with direct SPI writes, and
if that doesn't work better, a C module. But it might as well be
unnecessary, because there is going to be a change to how display is
refreshed in CircuitPython 5.x, and that might as well resolve this
problem.

I also tested connecting a small piezo speaker to the DAC pin and
playing some sounds, and while it is relatively quiet, as expected,
it's unexpectedly good, even without an amplifier. I might add that to
the next version, or make an audio shield for it.
