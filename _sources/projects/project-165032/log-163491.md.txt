# Got PCBs
Published on 2019-05-16 in {ref}`project-165032`.

It took some time, but the PCBs are already here (USB plug for scale):

I'm not sure I like the new style of mousebites from [@oshpark ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) — I can see how they save on drills, and it's probably also much
faster, but I can't remove them with a knife anymore — I have to use a
rotary tool. Then again, with the rotary tool it looks cleaner, so
maybe it's not so bad.

Also, looking at the number on the sticker, I think I might have
missed a couple. Oops.

I have now almost all the parts, except for the buttons — they are on
the slow boat. Unfortunately, I used the buttons as jumpers, to make
some of the GND connections and save on vias, so it won't work without
them.
