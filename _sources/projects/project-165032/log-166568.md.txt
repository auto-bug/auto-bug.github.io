# Firmware
Published on 2019-08-04 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I'm still waiting for the PCBs (they should arrive Tuesday, if DHL is
right), so I decided to work on the firmware a little bit. I expect a
bit more work than just defining the pins to be used in ``pins.c``,
because all of the CircuitPython boards that use SAMD51 seem to also
be using an external flash chip, and I skipped it for this design. But
turns out that the initial versions of CircuitPython for SAMD51 used
the internal flash for the filesystem, and the code is still in there
an working fine, all I had to do is to use a different linker script
and set INTERNAL_FLASH=1. And of course disable all the modules that
didn't fit in the now smaller flash space for the firmware, but I've
been through that already.

I also copied the display initialization code from PyGamer, so it
should hopefully all work. I tested it on an Itsybitsy M4 Express, and
it seems to run fine, though I didn't connect the display or buttons.

The board definition is at  [https://github.com/pewpew-
game/circuitpython/tree/pewpew_m4/ports/atmel-samd/boards/pewpew_m4](https://github.com/pewpew-game/circuitpython/tree/pewpew_m4/ports/atmel-samd/boards/pewpew_m4)  — if it works, I will submit it for inclusion in CircuitPython.

I will still need to work on that port of the pew library, possibly
with a small C module for the slow parts, but I will wait for the
working device to do that.
