# Case Version 6c
Published on 2019-09-30 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I decided to make one last attempt at the case and the button caps,
and that hopefully will be final. This time the PCB stays the same,
I'm only laser-cutting a new front plate. I made everything fit on a
single 100x100mm sheet of 2.5mm acrylic:

The D-pad cross is a bit larger and has rounder corners, the fire
buttons are round. Both have a cut in them for springiness. The middle
layer is split in two, to fit in the sheet â€” I would love to put one
more screw in there, but that would require a change of the PCB, so
no.

I will go with the regular 6x6mm tact switches with 6mm high stems,
however I will try to find ones that have as small actuation force as
possible, to make them softer and less "clicky".

While I wait for the order to complete, I will now need to work on the
website for the project, and then try to find a distributor willing to
sell it.
