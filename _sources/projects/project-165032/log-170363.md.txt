# Small PCB Update
Published on 2019-10-28 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I'm back from my vacation, and the order I made on the 1st of this
month at [@Elecrow](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848) , which was supposed to take 3-5 days is still on its way. Hopefully
it arrives before the month ends.

While I wait, I decided to amend the PCB design a little bit, to add
alternate button footprints to it, for those tiny 3x4x2.5mm buttons.
They fit inside the regular 6x6x6mm button footprints, so this way I
can use either kind, and have the option of using one of the existing
plastic button caps with this board. I need more PCBs anyways, to make
some final prototypes to give out for testing, and I was ordering a
PCB for the {ref}`project-167912` anyways. This time I used [@JLCPCB](https://hackaday.io/hacker/367545) , we will see how much time 3-5 days is for them.
