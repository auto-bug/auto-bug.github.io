# PCB Progress
Published on 2019-04-22 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I had some time over the holidays, so I made some progress on the PCB.
A new footprint for the buttons and for the screen connector, routed
everything except for the screen. Next I will need to add a truckload
of capacitors for the screen, and bunch of vias for the display
signals. I think I will go with SPI, because it's two resistors less,
it's faster, and I have the pins for it anyways. The whole PCB is
32x32mm right now.
