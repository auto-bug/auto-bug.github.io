# Acrylic is Springy
Published on 2019-09-26 in {ref}`project-165032`.

I finally had some time to assemble a second unit of the version 6
prototype, this time with the 6x6x6mm switches, and the "springy" caps
that have a cut through the hole. It works surprisingly well:

I still need to resolve a few issues: the buttons are too high, making
the caps stick too high from the case, the fire buttons rotate and get
stuck, and generally look bad, and the D-pad has some sharp corners
which are a bit inconvenient.

So I have another set of caps on order from Sculpteo (that was an
experiment, but it turns to be very expensive):

Those have less lee-way around the edges and smaller holes for the
shorter switches. I'm also testing a different way of making those
springy cuts in them â€” we will see how that works. Hopefully being
lower and having less leeway will prevent rotation of the caps.

I also started working on a final version of the laser-cut design,
with all the parts on one 100x100x2.5mm sheet of acrylic, for easy
cutting. The middle layer of the case had to be split in half for
that. Here I used round fire buttons, so the rotation shouldn't be a
problem.
