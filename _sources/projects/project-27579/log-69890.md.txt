# Second Version
Published on 2017-10-30 in {ref}`project-27579`.

The second version arrived from [@oshpark](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) , and it seems that the neck is fixed. Also, the hole for the LED in
the eye looks fine, and the vias that are buried under the solder mask
and the silkscreen are practically invisible.

I don't know where that brighter violet circle on the neck comes from,
but it's in the same place on both boards (for some reason I only
received 2 from, not 3 boards).

I'm not assembling the circuit on the back just yet, because I ran out
of parts for it â€” I will need more micro USB sockets.
