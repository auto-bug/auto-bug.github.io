# Firmware
Published on 2017-12-21 in {ref}`project-27579`.

So I finally sat dawn, assembled the second version of Blinka, and
flashed it with custom firmware. The firmware has only the pins I'm
using, and has a number of modules removed (like analogio) to make
room for touchio and audioio. Also usb_hid â€” so it can act as a
keyboard or mouse. Two of blinka's segments are also touchpads.

In other news, I finally got a hold of the vector files for Blinka, so
a bigger version with a coin cell on it is in the works (and I will
probably enter it in the contest too).
