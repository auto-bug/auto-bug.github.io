# Accelerometer Shield for D1 Mini

For all your shaky user interface needs.

    I need to do some experiments with accelerometers and robots, so I
decided to make this shield to make it a little bit easier for myself.
It uses a LIS3DH accelerometer, which also has some "gesture"
recognition built in — things like tap, double tap, shake, etc, — so
the shield could also be potentially useful for ESP8266-based devices
with a "physical" user interface.
