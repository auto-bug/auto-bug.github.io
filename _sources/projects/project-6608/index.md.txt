This is a talk voting machine. It doesn&apos;t do much, just records
the button presses. You put it next to the exit from a room in which a
conference talk was taking place, and people press the buttons while
passing next to it. Green button means they liked the talk very much,
yellow means the talk was fine but not that great, and red means they
think they wasted their time. The votes get compared with how the
committee selected the talks. Next year the process can be better.\


The machine has three buttons, red, yellow, and green, and it counts
how many times each of them has been pressed. A small button on the
side lets you display each of the counters on the 7-segment display on
the bottom. To reset the counters, switch the machine off.
