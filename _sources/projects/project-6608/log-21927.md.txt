# The End is Near!
Published on 2015-07-31 in {ref}`project-6608`.

The conference starts in two months, but by that time I need to
already have several working and tested devices, so I really need to
speed things up.

Since I won a coupon for laser-cutting in the Hackaday Prize, I
ordered some parts for acrylic boxes to hold the devices.
Unfortunately, I could only fit parts for 3 boxes in the order, as
more than half of the coupon's value went into shipping costs to
Europe. I guess I will make the remaining boxes of whatever I have
here, or laser-cut more parts locally.

I also ordered more buttons, so that I will have 4 devices with proper
colors, and one spare.

I decided to use a Pro Mini, and to not store the counts in the
EEPROM, but instead to display them on a 7-segment display. Switching
the device off and on again will reset it. That's a much more robust
and easier to use solution, I think.
