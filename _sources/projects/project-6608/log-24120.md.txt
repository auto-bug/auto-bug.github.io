# Four Units
Published on 2015-08-26 in {ref}`project-6608`.

I have four units assembled and ready to go. I might make one more
from the parts I have left, but the button colors are wrong, so not
sure.

I changed the way the display works. Pressing one of the three button
no longer switches the display on -- there is a separate small button
on the side that does it, and that also switches which counter is
being displayed. I think that this is much more convenient, plus saves
power.
