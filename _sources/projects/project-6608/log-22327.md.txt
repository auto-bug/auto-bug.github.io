# Shiny Box
Published on 2015-08-08 in {ref}`project-6608`.

Today I re-did the box properly. The trick was to save the SVG from
Inkscape, with the correct 0.01mm stroke thickness, and then open it
in Libreoffice and export to PDF. A little annoying, but works. I also
located the nearest hardware store and bought the nuts and bolts for
the prototype. I also have acrylic nuts and bolts ordered for the
final devices.
