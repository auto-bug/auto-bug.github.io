# Displays
Published on 2015-08-24 in {ref}`project-6608`.

The seven-segment displays arrived today, so I should have all the
required parts finally. I decided to start by getting the display to
display something. Since the display has the same pin pitch as the Pro
Mini, and for blue LEDs the voltage is just right, I soldered the
display directly to the board, just like in {ref}`project-7011` . Since I don't need the ":" sign in the middle, I left out the last 2
pins, so that only 12 pins of Pro Mini are used and I still have 6
pins for the buttons and their LEDs. A quick Arduino program to
display a number:


```apache
const int GND_PINS[] = {9, 11, 12, A1};
const int VCC_PINS[] = {A0, 10, 7, 5, 4, 13, 8, 6};
const unsigned char DIGITS[] = {
    0b01111111,
    0b00000110,
    0b01011011,
    0b01001111,
    0b01100110,
    0b01101101,
    0b01111101,
    0b00000111,
    0b01111111,
    0b01101111,
};


void show7seg(int number) {
    unsigned char digit;

    for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d) {
        digit = DIGITS[number % 10];
        number /= 10;
        for (int s = 0; s < 8; ++s) {
            digitalWrite(VCC_PINS[s], digit & (1 << s));
        }
        pinMode(GND_PINS[d], OUTPUT);
        digitalWrite(GND_PINS[d], LOW);
        delay(2);
        pinMode(GND_PINS[d], INPUT);
    }
}


void setup() {
    for (int s = 0; s < 8; ++s) {
        pinMode(VCC_PINS[s], OUTPUT);
    }
}


void loop() {
    show7seg(1337);
}
```

And voila, it's working!

Now I just need to rework it so that it doesn't use delay(), and add
the button handling.
