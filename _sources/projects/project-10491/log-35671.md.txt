# Soldering
Published on 2016-04-11 in {ref}`project-10491`.

So I'm back from the conference, and I finally got to try the
solderpaste that arrived before I left. I just quickly went to a local
pharmacy to buy the thickest needle they had, I cut that needle with a
dremel, and I was ready to go:

First, I applied a small drop of the solderpaste on each of the pads:

Then I carefully placed all the diodes, making sure they are all
aligned properly:

Next, I went to the kitchen and switched the stove on:

I waited a bit until the plate got hot, and pushed the board onto it.
Then waited until the solderpaste was properly melting, and pushed the
board off the plate.

The final effect looks good:

However, it doesn't work. Only one LED ever blinks, and that is only
for a short moment.

I think I must have applied too much soldering paste, and there are
some internal shorts of the signal pins. Now I'm thinking about some
way to recover the LEDs -- I think I will put the board on the hot
plate again, and pick the LEDs from it?
