# PCA9685
Published on 2017-02-23 in {ref}`project-13278`.

 [@Jonathan Beri](https://hackaday.iohttps://hackaday.io/hacker/32322)  asked in the comments why I didn't use PCA9685, but instead went with
an ATmega and my own code. To be honest, this is mostly because this
project is the continuation of my {ref}`project-9131`  project, in which I used a Pro Mini board.

But that got me thinking, and I went and checked if I can get some of
those chips cheaply, and I went ahead and designed a PCB for them:

I was actually so happy with it, that I went ahead and ordered them
from OSHPark. Today the boards arrived, and I assembled one and tested
it:

It works perfectly fine. You only get 16 channels (that's why I could
fit it on the standard D1 Mini shield), but you can stack 64 of those
boards (the address selection jumpers are on the bottom). Pretty neat.\
