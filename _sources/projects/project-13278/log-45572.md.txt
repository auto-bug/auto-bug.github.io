# Dumb 8-channel Servo Breakout
Published on 2016-09-14 in {ref}`project-13278`.

The first one is only a servo breakout -- it doesn't have any
components on it other than the pin headers. It lets you connect
servos to all 8 available gpio pins (leaving only rx and tx), so that
you can build a walking robot like #Katka.

To save space, the servos use angled headers. You can power them
separately, or (after closing the juper on the back) from the 5V pin
of the board.

There is a link to the OSHPark order page, and the design files and
gerbers are uploaded in the files section.
