# Faster Assembly
Published on 2017-08-01 in {ref}`project-13278`.

I recently got myself a cheap hot air gun, and as a test for it, I
assembled one panel of the servo controller boards.

I must say that it really changes everything. While applying the
solder paste is still a little slow without a template, soldering all
the parts is a moment, and they magically snap into their correct
positions. I had a few solder bridges due to too much solder paste in
some places, but a solder suction tool took care of those easily.

You can see on the photo the testing probes that I'm using to test all
the shields. The result this time was 100% working.

Soldering the pin headers was even faster, at least compared to the
manual process I used before. How come I didn't get one of those hot
air things earlier?
