# New Batch
Published on 2019-02-21 in {ref}`project-13278`.

I have sold the last of those servo controllers on Tindie a while ago,
coming up to the total of 128 units sold, but people keep adding it to
their wish list, so I decided to go and make another batch. This time
I'm not going to go to a fabricator — I discovered that I actually
enjoy the process of assembling them myself, and with just a few
orders a month I have more than enough time for that. So I just
ordered the PCBs. However, the times have changed — back then you
could only order cheap PCBs up to 5x5 cm in size, while today 10x10 cm
is the standard. So I panelized the latest version of the design, to
optimize the yield:

It's a bit of a pain to do in Fritzing, and I made several mistakes on
the way (sorry for the people at the PCB fab who already started
reviewing it when I cancelled the order), but after the third try
everything seems to be correct.
