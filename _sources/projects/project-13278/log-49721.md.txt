# Pimped 20-channel PCB
Published on 2016-11-30 in {ref}`project-13278`.

OK, the one-sided board experiment was fun, but not very practical.
Especially since all the fab houses out there make two-sided boards by
default, so I don't save anything. So I went back to the two-sided
board, applied some of the improvements I discovered while working on
the one-sided one, cleaned up the traces a bit, added a custom PCB
outline with rounded edges and an outline of the D1 Mini on the bottom
silkscreen, and I think it's ready for ordering. But I will wait one
more day, maybe I will spot some more things.
