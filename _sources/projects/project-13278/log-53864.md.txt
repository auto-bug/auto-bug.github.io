# Selling Prototypes on Tindie
Published on 2017-02-25 in {ref}`project-13278`.

I decided to give Tindie a try and sell the prototypes of servo
shields that I've built. I have three of each of the 16-channel and
20-channel ones. You can get them here: [https://www.tindie.com/stores/deshipu/](https://www.tindie.com/stores/deshipu/) 

I'm basically just getting rid of them, since the project is complete
and I don't really need so many servo controllers -- there are only so
many robots I can build at once. On the other hand, it would be a
waste to just throw them away or let them rot in my drawer -- so I'm
selling them.

While they are all manually tested, keep in mind that they are still
prototypes -- purple PCBs, hand soldering, possible hidden bugs -- I
will support them the best that I can, but I can't replace them
(because I only have 3 of each and I'm selling them all) if they stop
working. I can fix bugs in the firmware for the 20-channel shield, but
then you will need an ISP programmer (or any Arduino, in fact) to re-
program them -- I can help with that, but it does take some time and
effort to setup. The 16-channel servo uses an off-the-shelf chip, so
there are not likely to be any bugs.\


This is also an experiment in gauging the interest in this. If they
get added to a lot of wishlists, I might consider making a larger
batch of them.
