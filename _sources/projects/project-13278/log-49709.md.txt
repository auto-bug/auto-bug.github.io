# One-sided PCB
Published on 2016-11-30 in {ref}`project-13278`.

Looking at the design from the last log, I thought "Hmm, if only I had
some more room on the sides for the ground and power lines, I could
make this a single-sided PCB". Turns out I was wrong.

This is my best attempt at this. See that highlighted SDA line? If
only it wasn't there, or I could fit it somehow next to the SCL line,
everything would have been just fine. The track next to it would take
it place, and the power rail could get a connection on top, where that
track is now. Alas, there is no way to do that without a jumper cable.

Oh well, a jumper can't hurt, can it?
