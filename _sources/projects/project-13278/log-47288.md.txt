# Released
Published on 2016-10-09 in {ref}`project-13278`.

I decided to make a formal release of the 18-channel servo shield.

I fixed all the problems I could find (including the short between
power and ground), updated the firmware to have the servo sockets
numbered in a sane order, and added jumpers on the bottom for changing
the IÂ²C address (so that up to 4 shields can be used at once without
having to modify the firmware).

I also wrote simple libraries for MicroPython, NodeMCU and Arduino,
with some examples.

I'm releasing the whole thing under a Creative Commons non-commercial
license, because that's the license used by the PWM library that is
included in there. I would love to release it under a license that
allows commercial use (and to be able to order ready shields from
China), however, that would require me to rewrite the firmware to not
use that library (or get the original authors to change the license).
Too bad I'm too lazy to do that.\
