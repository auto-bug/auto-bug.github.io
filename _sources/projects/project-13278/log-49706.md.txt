# 20-channel Servo Shield
Published on 2016-11-30 in {ref}`project-13278`.

Yes, I keep refining the design. No, I don't actually need all those
servo shields. But it's a fun challenge. So I made another one, this
time controlling up to 20 servos at once.

Note how all the servo sockets are on the edges. That means that if
you use angled 3Ã—10 male headers, you can actually stack those. And
with the address selection on the analog pins, you can have up to 4
shields at once. That's 80 servos. Of course, if you just reprogram
them to use a different address, you could have hundreds of them.

So where are the two extra servo channels coming from? Turns out that
if your ATmega328p uses an internal oscilator and you don't have an
external oscilator connected, you can use those pins as gpios.

I'm still conflicted about whether to actually order this board or
not. One idea is to order it, rewrite the firmware in plain C, and
submit this to the 1kB contest...
