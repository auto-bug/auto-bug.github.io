# Version 1.0 of the 16-channel Shield on Sale
Published on 2017-03-24 in {ref}`project-13278`.

After the prototypes that I put on sale on Tindie sold within 2 days,
I decided to try and make a larger number of the servo controller
shields. I choose to do it with the 16-channel PCA9685 shields,
because to be honest I don't trust my own C code enough to inflict it
on unsuspecting people. In any case, you can now buy the production
version of this on Tindie here:

for-d1-mini-version-10/](https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/16-channel-servo-shield-for-d1-mini-version-10/) \


I ordered about 90 PCBs (the Elecrow's 10x10cm offer is the best bang
for the buck), but so far I only had components to assemble 5 of them.
More components ordered, and I will put them in stock as they arrive.
Here's a photo of the ready PCBs:

I also wrote proper documentation manual for this board, it's
available here: [http://16-channel-servo-shield-for-d1-mini.readthedocs.io/](http://16-channel-servo-shield-for-d1-mini.readthedocs.io/) \
