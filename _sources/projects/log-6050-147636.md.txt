# Reviving the Skull Tote
Published on 2018-06-07 in :ref:project-6050.

I have a number of prototypes of Tote that I have built over the
years, but the most presentable one is the one I pimped up in  [https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote/log/48853-pimp-your-bot](https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote/log/48853-pimp-your-bot) 

Unfortunately, that robot had a number of problems. Unlike all other
Totes, it was powered with a 2S lipo battery, with a buck converter
bringing to voltage down to 5V. That tiny buck converter would only
work for a few minutes, and then starting to shut down when the
current drawn by the servos made it too hot. Which would result in the
robot having a seizure. I also discovered that the motor in one of the
servos got stuck — rather common with the cheap SG90 servos — and
would need to be replaced.

So I decided to open up this robot, replace the power with a more
standard setup (a 1S lipo connected directly without any voltage
stabilization), add a battery charging circuit, and replace the servo.

Here's the USB port for the battery charging circuit:

And the replaced servo, primed with black paint, waiting to dry for a
dry-brushing:

And finally the whole robot, it all its robot glory:
