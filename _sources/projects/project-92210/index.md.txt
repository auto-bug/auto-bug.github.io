    I initially wanted to put all the data in here, in individual logs per
display, with a summary table in the details, but then I realized that
due to peculiarities of Hackaday we won't be able to edit each other's
entries, and it would be a bit difficult to keep track of the changes,
etc. Then I realized that this is an ideal use case for a wiki, and
decided to just put it all on a wiki on Github:Â  [https://github.com/deshipu/displays/wiki](https://github.com/deshipu/displays/wiki)
