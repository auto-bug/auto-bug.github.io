# imath.h
Published on 2016-12-22 in :ref:project-6050.

It took me two evenings of pretty much randomly editing code, trying
to make it as small as possible without breaking it horribly at the
same time, but I finally have a library with three basic functions,_iasin_,_iatan2_ and_isqrt_, which are_int16_t_ versions of the ones from the standard library. The angles are
returned in the range of -1800 to 1800, and the input to asin is
-1<<13 +1 to 1<<13. The whole library is around 700 bytes (644 at the
last compile) and should be relatively fast on the AVR (although I
didn't really time it). Oh, and the code is at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/imath/src/tip/imath.c](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/imath/src/tip/imath.c) 

If you see any opportunity to shrink it even more, please tell me!

Unfortunately, this is still way too large to make Tote fit in the
magical kilobyte. I might try with int8 versions next, but those are
not going to have enough resolution for a proper walk, unless I will
play with the ranges some more.

Here's a comparison of the values from those functions with the
standard library:
