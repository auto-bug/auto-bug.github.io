# Totes in the Wild
Published on 2015-08-28 in :ref:project-6050.

The main goal of all this work I'm doing on Tote is to make people
build their own robots. The idea is that they can start with Tote (or
the elements of Tote that they like), and grow from there.
Unfortunately, so far nobody that I know of decided to try it. Until
recently.

I got e-mails from at least two people who are now working on their
robots more or less based on Tote.

The first one is [#Micropython Quadruped Robot](/project/6877)  built by [@wagner](/hacker/38882) . He used a permaboard instead of a PCB for the body, and translated
the walking code from C++ into Micropython, to use with his pyBoard.
Last time I heard from him he still had some problems with the code,
but I hope he will get them resolved.

The second robot, [#Tote in the Wild](/project/7473) , made by [@Over.Unity](/hacker/89265) , also uses a permaboard for its body, but uses a Pro Mini just like
Tote. I got permission to show you [a gallery of photos of the robot](http://s1257.photobucket.com/user/over_unity123/library/Tote?sort=3&page=1) . It walks around pretty well now!

I've also seen some comments under the [post on Hackaday.com](http://hackaday.com/2015/06/03/hackaday-prize-entry-solving-the-shortage-of-walking-robots/)  from people thinking about building their robots, but I've never
heard from them again. If you are building a robot based on or even
just inspired by Tote, please let me know! I'd love to hear about it,
and see photos and videos of it.

Update: [#Tote in the Wild](/project/7473)  has its project page now and is finished.
