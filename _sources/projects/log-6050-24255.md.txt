# Totes in the Wild
Published on 2015-08-28 in {ref}`project-6050`.

The main goal of all this work I'm doing on Tote is to make people
build their own robots. The idea is that they can start with Tote (or
the elements of Tote that they like), and grow from there.
Unfortunately, so far nobody that I know of decided to try it. Until
recently.

I got e-mails from at least two people who are now working on their
robots more or less based on Tote.
