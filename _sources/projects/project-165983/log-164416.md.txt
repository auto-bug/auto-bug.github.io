# The PCB Design
Published on 2019-06-08 in {ref}`project-165983`.

This project actually started a looong time ago, back when I was still
playing with {ref}`project-20941` , {ref}`project-21578` was starting to take shape in my head, and nobody even dreamed about {ref}`project-27629` . I was inspired by the D1 Mini OLED shield, but I wanted some buttons
on it, and I wanted them to be arranged in a d-pad. Then other
projects happened, and I forgot about it, until recently, when I
started to play with those OLED displays again, and found my old
designs. Having learned a lot in that time, and having found some new
really tiny buttons, I decided to revive this project and e-design it.
I came up with this PCB design:

As mentioned in the description, it's basically the {ref}`project-19371` compressed to a smaller size (and with two of the buttons removed),
and with a display added on top. I used one of the free pins for the
display's reset (it has to be reset after powering on, and I didn't
want to waste the ESP8266 pin for that), but otherwise it's the same.

I had a moment of doubt when choosing how to connect the display: it
supports both I2C and SPI modes. In the end I decided to use SPI, even
though the buttons already use I2C. That is because SPI is faster and
supported in hardware by the ESP8266 (I2C is bit-banged).

Another challenge was fitting the 0.96" display and buttons on top of
the shield, without them conflicting with the pins. In the end, I
decided to use the same technique I used in the {ref}`project-165011` â€” angled pin headers soldered as SMD to the PCB, only this time I made
them a bit shorter too.

In the end I had some free space in the middle, so I decided to put a
buzzer in there, so you can even have sounds.
