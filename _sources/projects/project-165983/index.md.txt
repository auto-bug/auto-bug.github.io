    Often you need some kind of a user interface for your project â€” a
display, a menu, maybe some icons, some numbers or some plot, etc.
Sure, you can simply slap a display module on it, but then you still
need some kind of input. If your display comes with a touchscreen and
you are ready to handle the complexity in code, then great. Otherwise
you need to add a bunch of buttons, a joystick, an encoder or some
other way of selecting options. And since at that point you have ran
out of GPIO pins on your D1 Mini, you also need some kind of GPIO
expander. And then you have to put it in some box to attach the
buttons to, and it all gets complicated quickly.

So this is a quick solution for that problem: basically an OLED
display module and the {ref}`project-19371` squeezed together on a single small shield. You can even play games on
it, if you feel like that!
