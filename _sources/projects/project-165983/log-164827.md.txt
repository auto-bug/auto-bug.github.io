# Tindie
Published on 2019-06-19 in {ref}`project-165983`.

This shield is now available on Tindie. Unfortunately, for now I only
had one complete unit (because I only had two displays, and I need one
prototype for, uh, prototyping), and it's already sold. But as soon as
I get more displays (should take a week or two), I will put up more
for sale. You can add it to a wishlist to get a notification.

The price is a bit more than what I would like, but it's really a lot
of work soldering, and I had to re-order many parts with faster
shipping (because the ones I ordered with free shipping still didn't
arrive after two months).
