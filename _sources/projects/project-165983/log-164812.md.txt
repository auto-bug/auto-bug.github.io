# Buttons!
Published on 2019-06-19 in {ref}`project-165983`.

After re-ordering and choosing a faster shipping method, I finally
have those tiny buttons:

They are definitely better than those "reset" buttons I used on [nGame](https://hackaday.io/project/27629-game/log/87435-ngame-revisited) , but still a bit on the hard side.  Also very clicky and with
reasonable travel. The larger surface of the button itself makes a lot
of difference.

Soldering them is a bit hard — the contact pads are not large enough
to hold the buttons down with surface tension, so the hot air gun just
blows them away. So far the most efficient way is to just solder them
by hand, with the soldering iron, going from left to right and adding
the buttons as you go.

Unfortunately, the 20 displays that I ordered (2x10pcs order) turned
out to be 2 displays when they arrived (the seller admitted to a
packaging error and refunded the difference), so I only have one
prototype to play with and one unit for sale. More displays are on the
way, though, so expect it on Tindie near you soon-ish.
