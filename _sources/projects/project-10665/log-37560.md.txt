The PCBs finally arrived, of course while I was travelling. I'm
finally back, and I assembled the PCB. Of course, since they were
designed in a hurry, there is a number of mistakes.


 * somehow I managed to swap the RST and ADC pins with TX and RX,
 * there is a short circuit right next to the battery connector,
 * I didn't leave any room for IÂ²C pullup resistors,
 * I forgot to add room for the power switch.

The short circuit was fixed with an x-acto knife. I'm not really using
the RST and ADC pins, so I left them unconnected. For the serial
connection, I also left the pins unconnected and soldered wires
directly to the pads on the module. The power switch for now is on the
battery cable, and I will see about the pullup resistors later. So I
got the board working.

Next, I flashed Micropython on the ESP8266 and did a quick test to see
if the PWM signal for the servos works on all the pins -- including
the ones that are pulled up or down for the board to boot in the right
mode. For once it all worked great -- so that's one stone off my
heart.\


Next, I'm going to make a nice servo library for the Micropython on
ESP8266 (using the available PWM class, just wrapping it a bit for
convenience) and see if I can get the gesture/distance sensors to
work.
