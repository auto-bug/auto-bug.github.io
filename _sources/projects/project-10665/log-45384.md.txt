# Some Code
Published on 2016-09-10 in {ref}`project-10665`.

I worked a little bit more on this robot today. Nothing exciting --
adjusted the servo angles in the inverse kinematics, upgraded to the
newest version of MicroPython, recharged the dying battery, mapped the
servos to the right joints on the right legs, etc. I also published
the code and design files in a repository -- link on the left side,
under the photos.

This is really taking so much time mostly because I had so many other
things to do in the mean time. Hopefully the robot will walk soon.
