# Trinket M0
Published on 2017-09-19 in {ref}`project-10665`.

I recently dug out this robot for the maker faire (after seeing
similar laser-cut ponies on the first day), and when I made the pwm
shield for the Trinket M0, I decided that it would be the perfect
brains. Using the ESP8266 alone with its 8 free pins all used for
servos, with its software PWM kinda felt too hacky. I might still go
back to an ESP87266 with a PCA9685 chip, we will see. For now, I'm
using a Trinket M0 with a shield:

I will also need to think a bit about cable management:
