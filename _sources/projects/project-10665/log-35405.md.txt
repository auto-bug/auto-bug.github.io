# New Legs
Published on 2016-04-07 in {ref}`project-10665`.

I still got some time today to quickly bike to the FabLab and cut the
new legs. I didn't have orange acrylic that thin, though, so they are
transparent for the prototype. The final version can of course be
anything, maybe I will go for glow-in-the-dark, even!

As you can see, the new version fits perfectly -- the servos just snap
in and hold tight. I used some dirty broken ones and random horns
here, just to see if the fit.

The PCB should arrive within 2 weeks, I can continue with it then.
