# Servo Mounting Holes
Published on 2016-03-31 in {ref}`project-10665`.

A little bit of manual XML editing in Inkscape, and I have servo
mounting holes of exactly the dimensions I need. The new PDF is
uploaded in the "files" section above. It looks something like this:

I also moved the hind hips higher, to make the femur longer, so that I
can fit a servo there. I'm probably going to cut only the legs, and
use thinner, 2mm acrylic this time. But this will have to wait until
Thursday, when I can go to the FabLab.
