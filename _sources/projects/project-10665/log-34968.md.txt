# Leg Mechanism
Published on 2016-03-31 in {ref}`project-10665`.

I didn't really put much thought when designing the legs for this,
figuring out that I need to play with the physical parts first to get
the idea of what I actually want. So I just put holes in the places
where the segments join, and that's it. Now I need to somehow attach
servos to that. A little bit of dremeling, and I have a much better
idea of what I need now:

For one, I need thinner acrylic. This is 3mm, because that's what I
had on hand. I think 2mm would be perfect here instead. Second, I need
actual servo-shaped holes for the servos. That should be easy to fix.
FInally, the hind leg's femur is too short to fir a servo there -- I
will need to make that longer.
