# Controller PCB
Published on 2016-04-06 in {ref}`project-10665`.

While I wait to cut the new legs, I also prepared a new PCB for the
controller. I plan to use an ESP-12 module with Micropython on it to
control the eight servos, but I can't use the same board I had in {ref}`project-8521` , because Micropython allows PWM on different pins. So I went and made
a quick breakout board again, this time with plenty pull-up and pull-
down resistors, so that I can also use those pins that normally select
the boot mode:

As you can probably guess from the color, the PCB is ordered from
OSHPark -- I prefer it for the boards smaller than 5Ã—5cm, even though
the shipping from US takes ages. The connections are nothing special
-- all the servos are connected to all the PWM-capable pins, serial
and ground are available at the top, and power is at the bottom. I
used holes instead of pads for attaching the ESP-12 module, because
that is easier to solder. The antenna will stick out at the top. The
four SMD resistors provide pull-ups for CH_EN, GPIO0 and GPIO2, and a
pull-down for GPIO15. I will need to pick the values of the resistors
such that they work well with the servos connected to those pins
(well, except for CH_PD). I have the ADC and the serial pins
available, so I will probably use them for some sensors -- not sure
what exactly yet.
