# Better Servo Mounts
Published on 2016-09-19 in {ref}`project-10665`.

The new laser-cut body arrived, so I moved the servos to it. Among
other things, it has the new servo mounting pieces that I came up
with:

The screw holes are a little bit hard to drill in the edge of the 2mm
acrylic, and it's almost impossible to slide the servos on both sides
in at once -- I will need to extend the slots to make it possible to
slide them in place. Other than that, the whole thing looks much
better:

I now kinda regret putting that hole for the brains in the head,
because it turns out that the board would fit between the servos on
the body (and then the battery could go on the other side. I guess I
will need one more prototype at some point. For now I want to get it
to walk, though.
