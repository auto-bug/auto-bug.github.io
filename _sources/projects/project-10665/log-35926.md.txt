# Servos, Horns and Screws
Published on 2016-04-14 in {ref}`project-10665`.

I'm taking this slow, figuring things as I go. Since my other projects
went bad recently (I literally fried a PCB in one, and the other is
drowned in instant glue), I decided to do anything with this one. So I
went and screwed the servo horns to the legs properly:

As a side note, I really love this drill handle I got at some RC model
fair. It's perfect for making small, precise holes in delicate things,
where a dremel wouldn't work so well. So some drilling and some M1.5x3
screws, and the horns are all properly attached.

Next, I figured a way to attach the servos. I have some of those
foamed plastic sheets, and they are perfect for prototyping -- soft
enough to cut with a knife, but sturdy enough to build something out
of them. I initially wanted to make the whole robot from it (like I
did with {ref}`project-8521` ), but I wasn't sure what plastic it is exactly and if I can safely
put that into the laser cutter, without damaging the lens with the
fumes. Anyways, I cut some squares of that, cut an additional hole for
the cable in them, and glued them to the body with instant glue. Then
I simply used the screws that came with the servos to attach them to
that. Looks better than I anticipated:

One mistake I made, and I'm going to correct that in the "clean"
version -- I put the servos too high. But that should be fine for
testing.
