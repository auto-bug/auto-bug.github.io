# Attaching Servos to the Body
Published on 2016-04-14 in {ref}`project-10665`.

So while I'm waiting for the PCB, I mock-assembled the remaining legs
and started to do mockups with two-sided tape...

I'm still trying to find a good way of attaching those servos to the
body of the pony. Two-sided tape is obviously not the answer. Gluing
them there is sub-optimal, as I might need to replace them. I don't
have screws long enough to catch the servo ears and reach the body.

My current thinking is gluing some additional ears to the servos, near
the bottom, and then attaching those to the body with screws.
