# Failure: HC-SR04 Distance Sensor

What is a robot without sensors? Just a remote-controlled toy! It's
time to add some external sensors to Tote.

If you looked at the [PCB](http://tote.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/pcb2a.png) , you probably noticed the four pins broken out at the bottom. Yes,
they match the pinout of a cheap HC-SR04 ultrasonic range finder. It
should be a great way to add some obstacle avoidance or person
following capabilities to Tote, just like its older brother ÂµKubik
has.

So let's do it. The trigger pin is connected to pin 3 on the Arduino,
and the echo is on pin 13 -- yes, I ran out of pins and had to reuse
the LED pin for this. As a side effect, the LED blinks every time we
read the distance. A quick sketch to test the sensor:


```cpp
#define TRIG_PIN 3
#define ECHO_PIN 13


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT);
}


void loop() {
  unsigned long int duration, distance;

  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW);
  duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH);
  distance = duration / 58.2;
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");
  delay(500);
}

```

And lo and behold, proper readings:

Yay, so that's it, right? Now just add [some basic logic to the code](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/src/eda3cc49cbb6e0774d22d0e6b12d5ccc45cfd3c9/start/ping.ino?at=ping)  to make the robot stop when there is an obstacle in front, and we are
ready to go, right? Wrong.

For some reason, the robot stop immediately after the first step.
What's happening?

OK, let's connect the serial and see. The distance readings are all 0.
Why? Disconnect the battery, connect the Pro Mini to the USB and look
again. Readings are all connect. Disconnect the USB power and run it
from battery -- 0 again. Argh.

Wait a minute. The Pro Mini actually has VCC at 5V while it's being
powered from the USB cable, and 3.3V when it runs from the battery...
What were the power requirements of that HC-SR04 sensor again? Where
is the [datasheet](http://www.elecfreaks.com/store/download/HC-SR04.pdf) ...

Right, working voltage 5V. Sigh. Of curse I did check that before when
I was designing the board, but back then I still wanted to use a 5V
Pro Mini, and a voltage regulator. I later switched to 3.3V and
completely forgot about the sensor. So what can be done?

Well, looking at what I have lying around I took a 5V Pro Mini, a 2S
LiPo battery and a 5V voltage regulator, and quickly replaced Tote's
guts.**Warning**: the 5V Pro Mini doesn't have the RAW pin separated from the VCC pin
like the 3.3V version does, so don't connect it to the USB2TTL while
it's in the robot -- the power draw will quickly fry the power
regulator in Pro Mini. You have to remove it for programming.

You can see that now it kinda works, except for random times when the
sensor returns completely weird values. Maybe the sensor is broken?
Replacing the sensor didn't help much. Taking three readings in a
quick succession and taking maximum of them didn't help either -- it
seems, that the sensor just has some moments when the readings are
consistently bad. I can't think of a solution.

While this is a failure, I thought that I will publish it anyways, as
even the failures give us something to learn from -- often even more
than the successes. And speaking of failures, remember how I promised
to connect a Raspberry Pi to Tote? That's too cancelled for the moment
-- my A+ RPI suddenly stopped working, the power LED won't shine, the
activity LED shines weakly when powered from USB, and not at all when
powered through the pins. I guess I have a streak of bad luck. Oh
well.
