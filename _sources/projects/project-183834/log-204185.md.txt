# Magnets
Published on 2022-03-20 in {ref}`project-183834`.

Since I have to make one more version of this, because version two had
so many mistakes, I thought I will look a little bit at what
connectors could be used, and I found this:

It's basically pogo pins and magnets. This particular one has five
pins and is mounted at a right angle, so it seems perfect for my needs
if I used two pairs of them. So I fixed the problems with the previous
PCB, and made this:

I had to remove two keys on each half in order to get down to only 10
lines between the halves (4 rows, 6 columns), but otherwise it's very
similar to version two. I'm not entirely sure about the dimensions of
those connectors, so I left ample room around them â€” we will see how
they work once they arrive. I'm probably not going to use an actual
pink PCB, though.

I also broke out six of unused microcontroller pins (and the power),
so I might try doing some modules again.
