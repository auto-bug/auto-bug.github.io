# Version 4
Published on 2022-08-22 in {ref}`project-183834`.

I have been using Klap 3 as my main keyboard for a while now, even
when it was originally meant to be a travel keyboard. However one
thing that is not quite right with it is the thumb cluster being too
high â€“ it was intentional, to make the keyboard more portable, but now
that I use it every day, I would like to fix that compromise. The new
keyboard won't be as travel friendly, and I will skip the magnetic
connectors too, but it will have that extra row of keys that will let
me move the thumb cluster a bit lower (and move the slash/question
mark key back to its rightful place).

The changes are pretty much a little bit of copy-pasting, and adding
one more pin to handle the new row. Nothing too exciting. Again, there
was a large empty area of the PCB, so I added some decorative holes
there.

The PCBs are on order from [@Elecrow](https://hackaday.io/hacker/879772) , so they should be here in a week or two.
