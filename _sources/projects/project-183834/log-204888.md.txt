# Version 3
Published on 2022-04-12 in {ref}`project-183834`.

This is mostly fixing the mistakes from version 2: the holes are now
tight enough to hold the switches firmly, the routing is fixed so the
microcontroller and USB socket can be on the top of the right half, as
intended, a few diode footprints that were reversed have been fixed
too (but still all the diodes are reversed, so you need that flag in
software that flips the rows and columns). There are also some
changes: the halves are now connected with two magnetic connectors, so
they can be easily broken up for transport. However, to do that, I had
to limit the number of lines going to the other half to 10 (4 rows and
6 columns), so I had to remove some keys in the weirder positions â€” I
never used them anyways.

I will post an update with the design files, parts and code for this
later.
