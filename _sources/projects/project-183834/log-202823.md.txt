# PCB Design
Published on 2022-01-31 in {ref}`project-183834`.

I really started this to have an excuse to try the new version of
KiCad, but after half an hour I gave up and switched back to Fritzing.
Just like in the {ref}`project-182998` , the PCB is reversible and constitutes a half of the keyboard, the
other half is a second copy of the same PCB, but flipped over.Â
