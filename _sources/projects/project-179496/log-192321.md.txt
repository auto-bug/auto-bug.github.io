# The Keyboard
Published on 2021-05-02 in {ref}`project-179496`.

Once the switches arrived, I was ready to assemble the keyboard. It
took a little bit of detective work to figure out which way to solder
the diodes (I soldered them the wrong way, but fixed it in software,
thankfully SAMD21 supports both pull-ups and pull-downs on its pins),
and which set of holes to use on the left and right side for the
microcontroller board.
