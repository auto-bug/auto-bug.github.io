# Schematic
Published on 2018-05-30 in {ref}`project-158701`.

The PCB is ordered and should arrive in a few weeks, so in the mean
time I made a pretty schematic for the thing:

I got around needed a diode for the battery by using a switch â€” it
switches between the battery power or the USB power (or off when USB
is disconnected). Battery charging is connected to USB directly, so it
will always charge (unless the battery is full). I'm also putting a
way bigger resistor on the charging chip than the datasheet has,
because this is a tiny battery and I want to charge it at 8mA max. Not
sure what the chip will do in this situation, we will see. Since the
display connectors are done as pads, they don't show on the schematic,
so I added net labels to show what is connected to them.
