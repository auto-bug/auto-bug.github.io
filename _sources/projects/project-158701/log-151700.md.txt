# Barrette as the Base Station
Published on 2018-08-26 in {ref}`project-158701`.

Considering the latest redesign idea, I'm not aiming at a very small
pendant with just the microcontroller, connected to the {ref}`project-160167` for power. The hub will also be used for programming the display over
the USB, this way I can use a very small and nice-looking connector on
it, which won't interfere with the eventual resin casting.

That means that the PCB design will be greatly simplified, but I have
to wait for it until the design of connectors for the barrette is
finalized.
