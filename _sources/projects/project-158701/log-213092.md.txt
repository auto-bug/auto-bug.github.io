# Where Are We?
Published on 2022-11-01 in {ref}`project-158701`.

Hardware-wise, I think I'm reasonably happy with what I have – at
least it's more than sufficient as a prototype for testing. What I
need now is the software. I have tested the device with CircuitPython
– I have even written a GIF decoding library in pure Python specially
for this – and I'm confident this can work, but not with
CircuitPython. So the next step is to get the the firmware for this
working.

I can use the TinyUSB library to expose the filesystem over USB – it's
the same library that CircuitPython is using, in fact. And I can use a
super-optimized GIF library written by [@Larry Bank](https://hackaday.io/hacker/269676) . That should get me the minimal functionality. I can then also
experiment with sleep modes and touch and all that stuff.

The problem I am facing right now is setting up an environment for
development for the SAMD21. I will probably start with Arduino,
because that is already mostly ready out of the box, but there is
still some work with that, that I currently just can't get myself
started on. So until I get that going, the project is on hold.
