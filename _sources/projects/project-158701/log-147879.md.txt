# This Never Gets Old
Published on 2018-06-13 in {ref}`project-158701`.

The batteries arrived, and a quick test revealed why it didn't work
with the CR battery: of course I swapped the terminals of the battery
holder. Fortunately the voltage regulator I'm using has reverse
voltage protection, so nothing burned. A quick desolder, removal of
the plastic numbs that key the holder in the right position, and re-
solder in opposite position fixed it.

Though I still need to compile the firmware for it.

I fixed the PCB, but I still want to rework it to use a QFN version of
the chip â€” that should free some space on it too.
