# Touchy Power Switch
Published on 2018-07-14 in {ref}`project-158701`.

One more version of the pendant, this time with the mechanical power
switch replaced with an AT42QT1012 chip. This thing is tiny — about
2mm on a side — and I had to make a custom footprint for it. Of course
Fritzing decided to not cooperate and rolled out all of its SVG
parsing bugs. I got it to a state where it should probably work, but
it's not pretty.

I actually ordered this version, we will see in a few weeks how it
works.
