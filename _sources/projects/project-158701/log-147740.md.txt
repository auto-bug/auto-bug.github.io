# Some Paint
Published on 2018-06-10 in {ref}`project-158701`.

The exposed electronics are cool, but not everyone's idea for jewelry,
so I decided to try and do something to make it look better. Of course
the first thing I thought of was casting it in a solid block of resin,
but that would be difficult to do without breaking the switch and the
USB port. I will probably still drown it in hot glue at some point,
but in the mean time I simply painted it all black.

The acrylic paint didn't catch very well on the metal parts, so to
avoid "dirty" look I just scraped it completely off them.
