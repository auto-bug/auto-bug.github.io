# Ressurected
Published on 2020-08-12 in {ref}`project-158701`.

I'm bringing this project back from the dead, now that I have learned
a bit and got new ideas for it. I already wrote about a solution for
the battery problem — have the battery on the other side of the wires,
on your neck. I'm going to go with that, but since the {ref}`project-160167` is not ready yet, I will use a regular battery holder.

The other innovation is using a thin PCB, and a PCB USB socket — that
lets me make it really thin.

I slapped together a PCB design with those ideas incorporated, and it
arrived today, so I assembled it:

It's flashed an ready to be programmed. Next step is to compile a
version of CircuitPython prepared for it.

The last innovation I have is software: I no longer need to use BMP
files, as I wrote a Python library for reading GIF files. It's
probably not fast enough, but there is one more possibility — perhaps
I could include a C library that was recently created for SAMD21 for
playing animated GIFs as a CircuitPython C module — then they should
play at native speed.
