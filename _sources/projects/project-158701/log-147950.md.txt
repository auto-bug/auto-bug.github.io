More displays just arrived:

I now have three goals:


 * write a GIF decoder in C and include it in the firmware, so that
animated GIFs can be displayed,
 * redesign the PCB with a QFN package of the chip, and try to make it
all thinner,
 * figure a way to get rid of the physical switch, so the whole thing can
be cast in resin or something similar.

For the second point, I'm considering making a hole for the battery in
the PCB, and moving the microusb port and the charger electronics to a
charging station.

For the third point, I guess I would need to add a mosfet on the
backlight, figure out the sleep modes of the MCU, and make it wake up
on touch or add an accelerometer for waking up (and also for some
interactive animations).

However, for now the first point has priority.
