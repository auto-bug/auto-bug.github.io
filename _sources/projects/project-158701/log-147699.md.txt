# First Prototype
Published on 2018-06-09 in {ref}`project-158701`.

The boards from Aisler just arrived, so I could assemble the first
prototype. Almost all fits, except for the resistor next to the
battery charger, for which I had to cut a small hole in the plastic of
the battery holder. Fortunately there is room to move it.

Next is programming the little thingy. I got the bootloader burned on
it:

Now I need to compile some firmware and see how those touch pads work.
I still don't have the LIR1202 batteries for it, so I can't test if it
actually runs on the battery â€” it's possible the battery will be too
weak for the display. The CR1202 definitely is too weak.
