# Sunken Components
Published on 2018-07-04 in {ref}`project-158701`.

I have the promised design of the pendant using a QFN package of the
SAMD21. I'm also experimenting with reducing the thickness of the
whole device, by making holes for the battery, USB socket and power
switch, and mounting them inside those holes. I'm curious how this
will work.

In the mean time, I dropped the touch pads, so no touch sensing in
this version. But it's probably not going to be final, I still have to
experiment with getting rid of the mechanical switch and using
something else in its place, so that I could drown the whole thing in
resin. I wonder if I could keep the USB socket, but fill it with
something like wax before casting.
