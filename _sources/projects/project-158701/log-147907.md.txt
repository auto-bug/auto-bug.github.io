# First Picture
Published on 2018-06-13 in {ref}`project-158701`.

I finally sat down, compiled the firmware, adapted the ST7735 driver
to the new dimensions, and quickly hacked some code for displaying a
16-color BMP (because I already had similar code for the {ref}`project-27629` ). The result:

The colors are a bit funny because it's dark in here and the display
doesn't have good viewing angles either. But I think it's pretty nice.
