# Sharp Gadget
Handheld device with a sharp display.

I got my hands on a bunch of those cool SHARP memory displays, and I decided to
make a simple device to test them. The device is pretty generic: it has the
display, of course, three buttons on the sides, some i2c connectors, footprint
for a xiao dev board, and a power switch and pads for connecting a lipo
battery.

The goal here is to test the display, and maybe make something like a
tamagotchi with it.
