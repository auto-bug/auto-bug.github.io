# Designs Published
Published on 2024-10-21 in {ref}`project-188908`.

I just realized that for all this time I forgot to publish the designs files
for this robot, even though I even sold some kits of it to people at the
Hackaday Europe. I guess they were all too nice to ask me where they are.

In any case, both the design files and the basic walking code are now available
in a [repository](https://github.com/auto-bug/moobug) on Github. Write me an
e-mail or create an issue if you see anything missing or wrong. The JSON files
are EasyEDA (standard) exports.

Enjoy!
