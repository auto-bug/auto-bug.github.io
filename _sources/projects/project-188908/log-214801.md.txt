# The PCB Design
Published on 2022-12-30 in {ref}`project-188908`.

This is my first project where I completely switched to EasyEDA as a
PCB design tool. I honestly tried KiCAD several times over the years,
and it's just so hilariously bad at exploring designs, that I gave up
on it. EasyEDA is still far from ideal (especially the copper fills),
but it's not completely unusable.

In any case, I followed up on my fluffbug work, of course, but I made
everything except for the battery holder surface-mount. I found some
pretty nice low-profile smd female headers on LCSC, and the IDC
connectors for the servos also exist in SMD versions. This actually
gives me much more room on the PCB, because headers no longer take up
both sides.

There are still a few pilot holes for all the components, so there was
some work squeezing it all to fit, but in the end it came out rather
compact. Since the headers are double-row, I can use them to add
bigger "face" shields for the robot, with things like displays,
cameras, sensors or speakers. In fact, I went ahead and designed two
shields, one the size of the pico with a camera, and one bigger, with
an oled display and a speaker.
