    Some time ago I decided that the SAMD21 chip I originally used for the {ref}`project-180025` is not powerful enough, and impossible to get anyways due to chip
shortage, and I identified two options I could go with, ESP32-S2 and
RP2040. In the end I went with the Lolin S2 Mini board and the
ESP32-S2 chip, but I never stopped thinking how would the things go if
I went the other way. And then the Raspberry Pi Pico W board was
released, adding WiFi to RP2040, and it became even more tempting to
try it with the robots. I resisted several months, but eventually
caved in, and this is it: Moo Bug, a Fluffbug with a Pi Cow ("pico w",
get it?).
