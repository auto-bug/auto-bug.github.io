# The OLED Face
Published on 2022-12-31 in {ref}`project-188908`.

The PCBs arrived right after the holidays, and I quickly assembled
one, moved the whole legs from one of my fluffbugs, and here it is,
all working as expected. I just had to update the pin names in my
circuitpython code, that's literally it. But then I decided to try and
get to work one of the shields – the one with a display and a speaker.

The display just worked. I used the SH1106 library for displayio, and
I just had to rotate the display 180° and add a 2-pixel horizontal
shift to adapt it to this particular display. I got really good with
that working on all those handheld game consoles.

The speaker turned out to be a bit more challenging. I used a
MAX98357A I2S amplifier, because I had that on a module earlier and I
was confident it works well. Well, despite the schematic being
practically the same with the module (minus some unnecessary caps, as
usual), this one didn't work. The chip is a bit small QFN package, but
visually it looked soldered well. I tried a lot of different things,
until at fifth re-soldering of the chip with the hot-air gun, it
suddenly started working. I suppose looking good is not enough. Of
course with such a tiny speaker the quality is questionable, but it
does sound properly robotic, and it's surprisingly loud (I hardwired
the amplifier to maximum gain).
