    OpenMV has a couple of pins that you can use for connecting servos
(for example, if you want to mount it on a pan-and-tilt base), but you
can't use those if you also want to use the WiFi shield or any other
shield that uses up a lot of pins. Practically the only pins left to
use are the IÂ²C ones.

This is again the same as the 16-channel version of {ref}`project-13278`  and as the Adafruit 16-channel servo board -- it's just in a more
convenient form factor that plugs directly into the OpenMV board. Due
to space constraints, there are only 12 servo plugs -- the remaining 4
PWM outputs are broken out as a 1.27mm-pitch header. There is one
address jumper exposed, so you can stack two such shields.
