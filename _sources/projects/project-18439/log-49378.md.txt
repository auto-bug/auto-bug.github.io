# SWD Programming
Published on 2016-11-22 in {ref}`project-18439`.

Second approach to this is using the SWD protocol with my Chinese ST-
Link V2 clone. That requires getting at the SWD pins. Fortunately,
they are near the edge of the chip:

Then I connected it according to the pinout of my programmer (the
second one):

Now just "make program" in that template, and...


```
openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/stm32f0discovery.cfg -f extra/stm32f0-openocd.cfg -c "stm_flash `pwd`/main.bin" -c shutdown

Failure.

I suspect that I shouldn't be using the configuration for the
discovery board, but somehow write my own, however, I can't seem to be
able to find any examples...
