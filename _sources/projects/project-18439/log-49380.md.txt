# SWD Programming Continued
Published on 2016-11-22 in {ref}`project-18439`.

On a quest to configure OpenOCD properly. First of all, the error I'm
getting [was described in an issue](https://github.com/vsergeev/arm-bmw-sw/issues/1)  and seems like adding "reset_config none separate" fixes that. I got
a new error with this:


```

OK, so apparently the chip is write-protected. No problem, we can
unlock it with "stm32x unlock 0". After running that, and resetting
the chip, I finally got:
```
openocd -f extra/fff.cfg -f extra/stm32f0-openocd.cfg -c "stm_flash `pwd`/main.bin" -c shutdown

Which seems to be a correct flashing.

All this thanks to advice from [@jaromir.sukuba](https://hackaday.iohttps://hackaday.io/hacker/2648) , great thanks!

Now let's see if I can get a blink example to work...\
