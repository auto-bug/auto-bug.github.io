# Serial Programming
Published on 2016-11-21 in {ref}`project-18439`.

Last evening I made the first try at programming this thing. From the
datasheet and the schematic it looks straightforward: the BOOT0 pin is
connected to the RTC pin of the serial, the NRST pin is connected to
DTR, it should just work. So I connected the USB2TTL (also a WeMos
one), and gave it a go:

```
$ stm32flash /dev/ttyUSB0
stm32flash 0.5

http://stm32flash.sourceforge.net/

Interface serial_posix: 57600 8E1
Failed to init device.
```

No joy. To the datasheet then! Hmm, they mention a BOOT1 there too,
but it's nowhere to be seen as a pin... Let's google for it... [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22351703/stm32f030-and-boot0-pin](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22351703/stm32f030-and-boot0-pin)  Ah-ha! It looks like BOOT1 is a flag in something called "user flash
option byte", and it has to be set to 0 for the bootloader to start.
Shame I have no way to check it.

If that flag is set to 1 in this firmware, then the only way to
reprogram this board is to use an stlink programmer. Fortunately, I do
have one! Unfortunately, the SWD and SWC pins are not broken out, so I
guess I will need to do some precision soldering directly to the
chip's legs. Oh well.
