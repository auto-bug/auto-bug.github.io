# Still Alive
Published on 2016-10-12 in {ref}`project-7522`.

So I dug out this project. I never actually intended to abandon it for
so long, but somehow that's exactly what happened. Today I started
preparing for the [PyCon.PL](http://pl.pycon.org)  confernece, and looked at the shelf, and there it was. We are going
to do some Micro:Bit hacking at the conference, and I thought: "Hey,
it's a good thing to connect a Micro:Bit to!" So I took it out, blew
the dust from it, replaced two broken bolts (those acrylic bolts are
delicate when you tighten them too much) and added a bunch of wires to
the servos:

Every servo has now two extra wires: one going to the center tap of
the pot, and one going to the motor. Why? Because I want to be able to
do position and force sensing! Probably not right now and not with the
Micro:Bit, but I really want to do some experiments with complain
motion and such.
