Where are my robots? It's already 15 years into the twenty-first
century, and we still don't have robots everywhere. Sure, there are
some simple vacuum cleaners and some robo-pets for the ultimate geeks,
but that is not enough! Especially since the vacuum cleaners don't
even walk. We need more walking robots everywhere!

I think that one of the reasons why we don't have robots creeping and
crawling all around us is that researching walking robots is a time-
consuming, hard, and very expensive activity, traditionally confined
to the secret military laboratories. You need a big room with a crane
to hang your robot on, in case it falls, you need lots of hydraulic
actuators and a pump to power them, you need sophisticated sensors and
complex algorithms crunched on powerful computers, etc. At least
that's how it has been so far. Even building a simple hexapod from a
kit, which, is not much more than a simple toy, can set you back
hundreds of dollars. No wonder we make no progress.

That has to change. If we put a walking robot on the desk of every
high school student out there, and let them try hack on them and try
the craziest ideas, sooner or later someone will come up with a bunch
of cool tricks that let you solve that leg trajectory optimization
problem on an Arduino at 50Hz a second, instead of a supercomputer
crunching on a single frame whole day. We have a lot of corners we can
cut there. Plus, those same high school students are likely going to
continue their experiments and research and graduate in robotics and
build us that robot butler that we always wanted. Or something.

So that's my plan with Tote. To solve the humanity's burning problem
of glaring lack of robots, I'm working on a robot that is suitable as
a base for experimenting with robot gaits and related problems.
