# USB Type C
Published on 2022-11-20 in {ref}`project-186921`.

Today I bit the bullet, and designed a version of the ÂµGame22 with a
USB Type C socket. What finally convinced me was the fact that a
prototype I gave out had its USB port brutally ripped out, probably
because it was put in a bag with the plug still plugged in. The USB
Type C socket is much sturdier, and the particular model I choose has
through-hole mechanical mounting, so it should be really solid. The
main thing that was stopping me from doing this before was the fact
that there is no ready footprint in Fritzing for such a fancy part,
and that making such a footprint stretches the capabilities of
Fritzing pretty thin. Not only do you have to deal with elongated
plated holes, but also it's an SMD part that is two-sided. I ended up
making two separate parts, and placing them on the opposite sides of
the PCB.

Will the fab house accept this design? We will see on Monday. Will
this work? We will see in two or three weeks, when the PCBs and parts
arrive.

Shout out to the nice people at Mastodon who helped me to simplify the
routing and to get the resistors right!
