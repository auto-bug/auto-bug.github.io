# Second Version
Published on 2022-08-26 in {ref}`project-186921`.

The second version of the PCB and case just left the [@ElecrowÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/879772) fab and should arrive here early next week.

I made the following improvements:


 * Added a qwiic connector, so you can extend it with sensors. I decided
against having a 12-pin connector like in all the other PewPews,
because this is mostly supposed to be for the games, but I still
wanted an easy way to connect things.
 * Proper footprint for the kind of crystal oscillator that I have.
 * Swapped places of the USB and speaker, I think it's better when the
USB plug is further from the edge.
 * Fixed the short on the speaker.
 * Moved the reset and boot jumpers to the back of the device, so that
you have access to them with the case on.
 * Added vias on the SWD and SWC pins, so you can access them for
debugging.
 * Added a cutout for the switch, and moved the switch deeper, so it no
longer sticks out of the device's outline.
 * Used smaller holes on the front plate, so it should work with the nice
black screws I have.
 * Rounded the edges on the case elements.
 * Added a coutout for the qwiic connector.
 * Moved the labels for the buttons to make them more visible.

Overall, it's all small changes, but they make the device a little bit
more convenient and nice. I considered switching to USB-C connector,
but I couldn't be bothered preparing the footprint for it.
