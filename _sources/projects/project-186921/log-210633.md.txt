# Name Change
Published on 2022-09-06 in {ref}`project-186921`.

I decided to change the name of this project to ÂµGame 22, as a
continuation of {ref}`project-27629` . While it can run all the PewPew games, just like {ref}`project-165032` , the goals of the project are different than that of the PewPew
family of devices. It's not so much a cheap workshop accessory, as a
nice and comfortable CircuitPython handheld.
