# First Version
Published on 2022-08-25 in {ref}`project-186921`.

I was working on this behind the scenes for a while, mostly because I
didn't have the energy to write the logs, and because the progress was
really slow. It's my first time using the RP2040 chip, so I wasn't
even sure it will work. But I did design the PCB, and when I ran out
of excuses, ordered it together with the laser-cut acrylic parts from [@Elecrow](https://hackaday.io/hacker/879772) .

There isn't really that much going on here. We have the RP2040 with
all the required caps, resistors, crystals and flash memory, we have a
magnetic speaker with a FET, power switch, seven buttons and a
display. Very basic. Oh, and I used lead-free solder for the first
time. It's a bit annoying with how it doesn't melt as well as the
regular one, but it's not too bad.

The first test of the RP2040 required a few passes with the hot air
gun to get working. You can see I have wrong footprint for the crystal
- that's the only kind I could get quickly. Next version will have the
proper footprint. I have to say that having a UF2 bootloader built-in
into the chip is super convenient, no need to flash anything with a
programmer.

Oh, I forgot. There was a problem with the speaker. Since I added the
FET at the last moment, I didn't remove the ground seed from the pad,
and as a result the pad was shorted to the ground. A few deft cuts
fixed this. It will also be fixed in the next version.
