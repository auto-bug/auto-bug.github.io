# A Year Later
Published on 2020-09-16 in {ref}`project-167912`.

I must say I'm a bit disappointed with this project. I was expecting
it to become my default keyboard, but somehow it never did. It just
always felt ever so slightly wrong. Initially I thought it was the
minimally tighter key spacing, or the improvised stabilizers, and I
think they do contribute to the weirdness a little bit, but after
building the {ref}`project-174095` I can confidently say the main reason for this keyboard being
uncomfortable a the switches.

Those sunken low-profile switches are very different from the regular
(not sunken) chocolate switches — not only they are not nearly as
clicky, but they also have this very annoying resistance — as if they
didn't fit together very well.

And since the switches are really the bulk of the keyboard's cost, I
don't see much chance for rescuing this project.
