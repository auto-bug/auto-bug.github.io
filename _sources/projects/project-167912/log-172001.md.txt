# Details
Published on 2019-12-17 in {ref}`project-167912`.

I finished up a couple of details recently, so that I can say now the
project is finished.

First, I added support for the CapsLock key to the firmware. It's
still a hack for now, so the change is not merged upstream, but it
works well enough for me, so I decided to keep it. I will work on
getting that merged to CircuitPython with a proper API.

Second, I replaced the USB cable with a flat one that just arrived.
Flat keyboard â€” flat cable. It also doesn't get tangled as much.

I also disabled all the USB endpoints except for HID keyboard, so that
it's visible only as a regular keyboard when connected to a computer.

Finally, I stuck some nice padding to the back of the keyboard. Those
are sticky pads for something called "fingerboard", whatever that is.
They work well enough. I had to do two layers in the middle, to
prevent it from wobbling, because it's a bit thinner there, with no
stabilizers in that area.
