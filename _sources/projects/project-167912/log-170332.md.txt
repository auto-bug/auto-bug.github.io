# Low-profile Switches
Published on 2019-10-27 in {ref}`project-167912`.

The first 50 switches have arrived, and I can finally compare them
with my footprint and also see how they fit in the PCB. They are
actually good 1.7mm lower than the "regular" kailh chocolate switches:

(Note that on this photo the switch slipped one step lower than it
should be — it doesn't sink into the PCB that far, only as far as the
part from witch the legs protrude.)

The footprints and the spacing both look correct, so I will be
ordering the PCB in the coming days (I'm waiting for the new plate
for  {ref}`project-165032` to arrive, so that I can see if I will need a new PCB for it as well,
then I can order them together and save on shipping.)
