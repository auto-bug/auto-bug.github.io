# Mechanical Construction
Published on 2019-10-06 in {ref}`project-167912`.

This time I want it to be just a PCB with the low-profile Kailh
cholocate switches held just by the soldering. Those switches are
sunken into the PCB, so I will need to have cutouts, the footprint
looks like this:

The top two holes are only for mechanical attachment, the bottom two
are the actual switch. Since I plan to design the part in Fritzing,
and Fritzing parts can't have cutouts as a part of them, I will just
put this on the silkscreen, then export that to SVG, and create a
board outline with all the cutouts as a custom board shape:

A SAMD21 microcontroller and a USB socket will be squeezed somewhere
between the keys. I also have stabilizers for the long keys ordered,
but I will handle those when they arrive, so I can actually test them.
I will probably need to mak custom push-rods for them, from paper
clips.
