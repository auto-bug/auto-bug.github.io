# Caps
Published on 2019-10-10 in {ref}`project-167912`.

The key caps have arrived, so I finally can do the measurements for
the placement of stabilizers, figure out where the USB socket and the
MCU should go, and maybe finalize the PCB. Turns out the 1.5u keys
don't have stabilizers, so that leaves me with just the 5.5u space,
2.5u shift, and 2u enter and backspace keys. I can also test spacing
between the keys, to make sure the caps don't collide.

(Sorry for the hair, it's the shedding season.)

I was actually quite surprised that there are many alternate key sizes
for some of the keys â€” specifically the enter, shift, alt and fn keys.
That gives me a little bit more flexibility.
