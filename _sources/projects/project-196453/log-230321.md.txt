# The Design
Published on 2024-06-06 in {ref}`project-196453`.

I started with the {ref}`project-27579` files I already had from my previous projects. I had to resize and fix
them a little to fit on the new form factor. Then it was just a
question of finding the right kind of flashing LEDs â€“ unfortunately I
couldn't find them on LCSC, so I just ordered them from Aliexpress. I
got two kinds, slow and fast, and I plan to mix them.
