# Assembly
Published on 2024-06-06 in {ref}`project-196453`.

I finally got both the PCBs and the LEDs, so it's time to assemble it
all.

In hindsight, I should have left the traces covered by soldermask
somehow, but it was too hard to do in EasyEDA. Oh well, they are not
visible anyways.

The lights look good, especially after being covered by hot glue on
the back side, to improve light diffusion. I probably should have
added one more LED in the upper left corner of the logo.

I think that if I do something similar again, I will place the LEDs
outside of the transparent areas, and let the hot glue pipe the light
to them. This way there won't be visible spots of light.

All in all, the project is very simple, but should be useful at the
conferences.
