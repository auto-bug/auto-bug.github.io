    Some conferences offer those colorful ribbons that you can stick to
your paper badge to indicate your interests, or the fact that it's
your first time on that conference, or your pronouns, etc. I decided I
want something like that to indicate that I'm interested in Python on
microcontrollers, but I thought that maybe making it a little bit more
flashy, with blinking lights, would be a good idea.
