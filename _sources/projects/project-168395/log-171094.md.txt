# You Shouldn't Doesn't Mean That You Can't
Published on 2019-11-18 in {ref}`project-168395`.

The PCB for the crazy tiny keyboard arrived as well, and I had a stab
at soldering the buttons by hand. I got as far as the second button of
the second row and decided that it's not going to work. My tiny
soldering iron tip is simply too big for this.

I might give it another try with solder paste and hot air gun, but I
really don't have much hope for it. It's also pretty inconvenient for
typing with your thumbs, so I guess I will just call this one a
failure.
