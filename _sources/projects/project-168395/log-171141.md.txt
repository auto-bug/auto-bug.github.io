# Contest
Published on 2019-11-19 in {ref}`project-168395`.

So a few words about this project in the context of the contest it was
created for. Sure, the design is very simple, and it wasn't much work,
but I think it's a genuinely useful product, especially for beginners.
It lets you experiment with real mechanical keyboard switches (and
some nice blinky lights) without large risk usually involved in making
a large expensive keyboard. It fits several of the contest categories:


 * The Weirdest Feather — fine, maybe it's not so weird — not as weird as
the {ref}`project-19921` or the {ref}`project-168441` . But it's not your usual "sensor breakout" add-on either.
 * You’ll Cut Yourself On That Edge — it so happens that the Kailh
chocolate switches used in this design are relatively new — I think
the first keyboards using them only appeared a year or two ago, and
they are still a rarity in the mechanical keyboard communities. You
can tell by how hard it is to find key caps for them.
 * Retro Feather — what is more retro than a mechanical keyboard? Those
are the kinds of keyboards that were made for computers back when they
costed more than an airplane and had the computing power of a watch.
 * Assistive Tech — a dedicated macro keyboard such as can be built with
this is an excellent usability- and accessibility-enhancing tool. But
you don't have to stop there — experiments with chording, durations,
modes, etc. can lead directly to improvements with our current
keyboards and other input devices. You can also use it as a component
in more complex devices — add an accelerometer and you ave an airmouse
with three buttons.
 * Wireless Feather — fine, that's the second category that doesn't apply
to this project.
