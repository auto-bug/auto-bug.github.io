# Execution
Published on 2019-11-11 in {ref}`project-168395`.

So let's get this thing done. First, it's good to start with a mock-
up, so that we catch any obvious errors:

I also checked that the APA102 LED fits inside that window in the
switch. All seems good, so let's work on the footprint. Kailh has some
dimensions in their docs:

That lets me draw the footprint in Inkscape and import it into
Fritzing. I already had a footprint for the APA102 LED, so all that is
left is to route it all:

The keys go to their own pins each, and the LEDs are chained together
and connected to the SPI bus. The DRC check passes, I can't see any
obvious errors, but it's past midnight already, so I won't be ordering
this PCB yet. I will wait until morning, to take one more look at it,
and then order it, like a responsible person that I pretend to be when
someone is looking.
