Published on 2016-02-13 in {ref}`project-3694`.

This robot waited on the shelf for a long time (enough for its LiPo
battery to go bad), so when I got the {ref}`project-1313`  board, I decided to install it here. I'm also replacing the Pololu
servo controller I used in there with a much simplier {ref}`project-9131`  that I built out of a Pro Mini board. Other parts will probably
remain the same, although I might need to skip the speaker, as ADC and
DAC are on the same pin, and I need that battery voltage monitoring.

I started by testing the I²C communication between OpenMV and the
servo controller. Since OpenMV is still in beta and not even yet
released to Kickstarter backers, I didn't expect this to Just Work™
out of the box, and I was right. First, turns out that the_SDA_ and_SCL_ pins are reversed compared to [what the documentation says](https://openmv.io/docs/openmv/quickref.html) . That was relatively easy to figure, I just swapped them and suddenly_I2C.scan()_ started showing my device. Splendid!

Then I just copied the line that I previously tested with PyBoard:


```python
bus.mem_write(struct.pack("<H", 1500), 9, 0)
```

and... nothing happened. Except that further_I2C.scan()_ stopped finding anything, and further writes just returned_IOError 16_ until the OpenMV board was hard reset. Interesting. I connected my
pocket oscilloscope to see what is happening, and sure enough, the_SCL_ line is being held low by the master after the first write. Looks
like a bug in the firmware.So I started looking through the source code ( [it's available on Github](https://github.com/openmv/openmv) ). Initially I looked at the_soft_i2c.c_ file, but soon I realized that it's only being used in the mlx
module. Perhaps the authors had the same problem, and used software
I²C to work around it and get the mlx to work?

Then [@Arsenijs](https://hackaday.io/hacker/61401)  suggested on the hackaday chat that this may be related to [an I²C bug that was recently fixed in Micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/1765) . I tried disabling IRQs before calling the_I2C.mem_write()_, and lo and behold, it works! It's not necessarily this bug (as it
only manifests when there is an error reading or writing), but
switching the interrupts off makes the Micropython not use DMA, and
apparently this works. Happy with that, I wrote about my findings [on the OpenMV forum and went to sleep](https://openmv.io/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=51) .

Next day I took Henk, opened it, ripped out the servo controller,
connected the servos to the new one, drilled a hole for the camera to
stick out, and here I am now, wondering how to best arrange the UBEC
and battery inside. I will keep you updated.
