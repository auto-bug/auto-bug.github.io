# Ready to Program
Published on 2014-12-27 in {ref}`project-3694`.

This robot took me two days to build from scratch, but I'm pretty
happy with it already. I think it's pretty much finished mechanically
(only missing some rubber endings on the legs). Software-wise, I have
ported my maestro controller library to Micropython, so I can already
move the individual servos from the REPL console of the PyBoard, over
USB. The next step will be to port the inverse kinematics code, adjust
it to take into consideration that there are six legs now and that
they are at various angles to the body, and then make it walk.
