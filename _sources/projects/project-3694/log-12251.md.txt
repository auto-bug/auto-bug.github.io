# Moving a Leg and Making Sounds
Published on 2014-12-29 in {ref}`project-3694`.

The software for the basic inverse kinematics is going slowly, mostly
because I'm reorganizing the code that I already used in all the other
robots, with a goal of making a library of it. In the meantime, I had
a little distraction: I added the buzzer to a DAC pin of the [PyBoard](http://micropython.org) , and it turns out it's fast enough to [play WAV files](https://micropython.org/doc/tut-amp-skin) ! After some mucking around with the [turret lines from Portal](http://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Turret_voice_lines) , I finally used [bfxr](http://bfxr.net)  to generate some simple bleeps and pews, and then [avconv](https://libav.org/avconv.html)  to concert them to 8bit, 11025 rate files.

A video showing that I have control over the servos and the speaker:
