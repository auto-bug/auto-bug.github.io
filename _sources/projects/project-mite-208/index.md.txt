Small development board with CH32V208.

I recently started to play with the CH32V family of microcontrollers, and
they are a lot of fun, but most ready development boards you can get are for
the cheaper models in the family, with very little RAM. This is fine for
blinking LEDs, but if you want to start playing with USB, filesystem, displays,
and graphic formats, you need something with a bit more oomph. Those models
have demo boards that try to fully show off the capabilities of those chips,
so they are huge, with multiple USB sockets, bluetooth antennas, and ethernet
sockets. I wanted one of the more powerful chips but on a small devboard.

I quite like the Xiao and QtPy form factor, so I made a board that is
compatible with that. While the chip supports bluetooth and ethernet, those
pins are not broken out â€” I just want the 64kB of RAM in this case.
