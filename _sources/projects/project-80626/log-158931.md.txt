# Build for ESP8266
Published on 2019-01-31 in {ref}`project-80626`.

If you want to try playing with this, but don't feel like compiling
your own MicroPython firmware, I prepared a build for the ESP8266 with
the {ref}`project-19371` and an ST7735 display module:  [https://github.com/deshipu/micropython/releases/download/v1.10-34-
g711238a95-dirty/firmware-combined.bin](https://github.com/deshipu/micropython/releases/download/v1.10-34-g711238a95-dirty/firmware-combined.bin) 

I also updated and rebased the "stage" branch, here:  [https://github.com/deshipu/micropython/tree/stage](https://github.com/deshipu/micropython/tree/stage)
