# MicroPython Branch
Published on 2019-01-08 in {ref}`project-80626`.

I just realized that while this project page links to the repository
with the plain python portion of the library, the portion that is
written in C is harder to find. So here it is: [https://github.com/deshipu/micropython/tree/stage](https://github.com/deshipu/micropython/tree/stage) 

The branch is a little bit dated, since I didn't upgrade it in a
while, but if you look at the three last commits, you will see all the
required code. It's not much, just enough to make the plain python
version fast enough. Enjoy!\
