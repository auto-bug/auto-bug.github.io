# Support Larger Resolutions
Published on 2018-03-11 in {ref}`project-80626`.

After a bit of work, I can now use the whole 320×240 screen of the
M5Stack — unfortunately I had to change the C sources a bit, to use
16-bit variables for the coordinates. That was a lack of foresight on
my side, but it's now fixed and the pull requests for the change are
up.

I also optimized the sprite drawing routines a little bit, and fixed a
bug that would sometimes make the library fail to refresh some
sprites. You can now also use floating point values for the sprite
positions, and they will be rounded during the rendering.
