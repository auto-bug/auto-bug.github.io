# M5Stack Support
Published on 2019-08-01 in {ref}`project-80626`.

I added support for the buttons on the game face of M5Stack, (it's
very similar to my {ref}`project-19371` , I basically just had to change the numbers for the button maping,
the I²C address, and negate the output). Together with the automatic
2× scaling, it means you can play the µGame games on it now (and, what
is more important, easily make your own).

What I don't like is the noise from the speakers — for some reason
that happens only when the face is connected, and not on USB — perhaps
grounding issues? There is no sound from the game, because so far
MicroPython doesn't support it (though technically it's possible,
someone just needs to write the code).
