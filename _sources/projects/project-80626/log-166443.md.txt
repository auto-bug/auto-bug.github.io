# Scaling
Published on 2019-08-01 in {ref}`project-80626`.

One problem with supporting devices other than {ref}`project-27629` is that they use different displays. The 160×128 version of ST7735 is
not that bad — there is just a strip of 32 unused pixels — but the
ILI9341 is almost twice as large, with 320×240 pixels. So you either
play the game on a tiny postage stamp, or you adapt it to the platform
— but the 16×16 tiles and sprites are still too small.

That's why I just added a "scale" optional parameter to the Stage
object in the library, that allows you to scale the display 2× or
more, giving you back the chunky pixels we so love.
