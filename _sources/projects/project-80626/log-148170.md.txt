# More Players
Published on 2018-06-20 in {ref}`project-80626`.

Looks like my decision to abandon {ref}`project-86818` and instead focus on improving this library and making it work better
on the original {ref}`project-27629` might have been right. New devices are popping up left and right.
Adafruit has recently leaked some information about the Arcade
FeatherWing they are working on, and now [@JarrettÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3720) alerted me about a new device made by Odroid: [https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid_go/odroid_go#arduino](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid_go/odroid_go#arduino) 

From the point of view of hardware, it uses the same stuff as the
M5Stack, so this library should already work on it. I ordered one ($48
with shipping for me), and of course will attempt to get my games to
run on it. Still a bit more than the $11 I paid for the [TTGO 1.0](https://hackaday.io/project/86818-game-turbo/log/138041-esp32-with-ttgo-10) , but this one has the button and a case already. We will see how good
those buttons are...\
