# PicoSystem
Published on 2021-10-07 in {ref}`project-80626`.

Pimoroni has released their PicoSystem, which is a handheld game
console with an RP2040 microcontroller — and since it runs
CircuitPython, of course I had to make it run the Stage library as
well. I received a beta unit from Pimoroni, and with help from
Gadgetoid, we got everything working:

The changes are getting merged into CircuitPython even as we speak, so
they should be available in any version greater than 7.0.0 (not in
7.0.0 itself, though, too late for that).

I had to fix screen scaling, because I forgot to implement it in the
CircuitPython version — I only had it working in MicroPython. I also
improved the menu program, so that it adjusts to the screen size.
