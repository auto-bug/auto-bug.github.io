# Meowbit
Published on 2021-08-30 in {ref}`project-80626`.

Today I finally sat down and got Stage running on the Meowbit. I had
this very neat little console in my drawer for years now, and
CircuitPython has been ported to the STM32 chip that it uses, but
there was [a bug preventing me from re-initializing the display to the settings
that Stage expects](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/3873) . A few days ago I got reminded about Meowbit, and realized that I
don't have to re-initialize the display to make it work, I can change
the default display settings, since I have to recompile CircuitPython
firmware for it anyways to include the parts of Stage written in C.

So here it is:

As an addition, I also modified to Stage library to allow using
different sound output than the audioio module it defaults to. The
Meowbit, for example, uses audiopwmio, but you could also use
audiobusio for a device that uses I2S.

If the pull request is accepted, the support should be available in
CircuitPython 7.0 to be released soonish.
