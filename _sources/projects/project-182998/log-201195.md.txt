# NKRO and BOOT
Published on 2021-12-10 in {ref}`project-182998`.

I took the opportunity with this new keyboard and worked a bit on my
uKeeb CircuitPython library. With the custom HID descriptors we can
have an NKRO keyboard, but there is a small problem: the bitmap device
that this uses won't work in BIOS or with legacy KVM devices, as those
expect a BOOT device. Fortunately there is a way around that: when the
host expects a BOOT device, it must send you a special message telling
you that, so we can switch to that protocol when needed.

The support for receiving that message was recently added to
CircuitPython in version 7.1.0, so we can now add the NKRO code to the
library by default.
