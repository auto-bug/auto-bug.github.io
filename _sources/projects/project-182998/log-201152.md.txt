# Assembled
Published on 2021-12-09 in {ref}`project-182998`.

First I needed to test how good the stitching of the two halves
together was.

It tuns out to be pretty good. I didn't even have to use the holes I
added to the edges in case there was a need for more mechanical
stability. The boards are connected by a male pin header, that was
soldered in one side, had its plastic part removed, and then was
inserted into the other half and bent into U-shape until both halves
were parallel. Then I tinned it with copious amounts of solder, to
make it look like the rest of the pads on the board.

With that done and tested, I soldered the diodes, the MCU and the
remaining components. Then I added the Purpz switches and MBK keycaps
(somewhat randomly labeled, I'm still waiting for the MBK Legends
groupbuy), and we have a keyboard.
