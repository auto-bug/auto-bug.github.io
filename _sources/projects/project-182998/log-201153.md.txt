# Programming
Published on 2021-12-09 in {ref}`project-182998`.

All that is left is to program it. As usual, I wanted to use
CircuitPython, with my [ukeeb](https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb)  library. I flashed the bootloader with a JLink through a header I
temporarily soldered to the stitches in the middle, and then I flashed
the most recent CircuitPython. I'm using the board definition I made
for {ref}`project-171381` , because it exposes all the pins of the SAMD21.

Next it's time to decide on the layout. For now I am using something
like this:

The labels on the bottom of the keys is what happens when you hold the
key and press another one. There are two traditional layers, switched
with the Raise and Lower keys. One thing I added compared to my
previous keyboard, is that if you press Raise and Backspace, you get
Lower, and if you press Lower and Space you get Raise â€” this way you
can type with one hand with access to both layers. This helps when
playing games.

I'm not entirely happy with the modifier keys yet, I will probably
reshuffle them somewhat, and I will probably swap the arrows keys and
the home/end and pgup/pgdn layers. Otherwise it works for me.
