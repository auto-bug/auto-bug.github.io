# Schematics

I've been asked to provide schematics of the PCB. I must admit, that I
neglected that part a little, mostly doing all modifications and
connections directly in the PCB view, but now I cleaned up the
schematic view a little better.

Here's the schematic for PCB2 (the ones I've been giving out and which
you can order from dirtypcbs):

And here is the reworked PCB3, which will be available soon (I need to
order and test it first):

As you can see, there isn't really much to it, it's mostly connections
for all the servos and the small voltage divider for battery
monitoring.
