# World Changing
Published on 2017-09-07 in {ref}`project-27161`.

How will this project change the world? Probably very little. For one,
in the new world there will be the shields available for people to use
in their projects â€” so it will be slightly easier to start, slightly
easier to build something with a display or buttons, and maybe even
slightly easier to learn something new about electronics. There will
also be a new version of the author of this project, with slightly
more experience, possibly using that experience to build further
projects. The world will also be slightly more polluted, the
distribution of wealth will shift minimally, and so on.

So is this project world-changing? Definitely! Will you notice the
change? Only if you are paying attention. Will it matter? It will to
me, and perhaps a bunch of people who want those shields.\
