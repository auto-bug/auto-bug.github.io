# The Only Shield You will Ever Need
Published on 2017-10-10 in {ref}`project-27161`.

mailbox. So I can finally assemble some of the shields. Spoiler: the
proto shield is the only one that works, and only because it has no
components.

Impressive, eh? But to tell the truth, it will be super useful for the
small trinket-based projects.
