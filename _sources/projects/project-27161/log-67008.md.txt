# Trinket M0 TFT — Mirrors, how do they work?
Published on 2017-09-12 in {ref}`project-27161`.

The first of the PCBs I ordered for the {ref}`project-27033` just came, and I started assembling it:

I can get a really low profile with the narrow headers and with male
headers that have the plastic removed, so this is nice. There is
however a slight problem. Even though the display is the only
component that goes onto that PCB, I still managed to get it wrong: I
used a mirrored footprint, copied from my previous design that had the
connector on the underside of the board. But this board has the
connector on the top, so it's rotated 180°. And it's too far from the
other edge of the PCB for me to just rotate the whole display and use
it like that.

And of course, I used the same connector design in the next two
versions that I ordered, so they are also going to be wrong. So I
quickly went and ordered a fixed version:

Even the routing was simpler with the mirrored display. I ordered this
one with Super-Swift service, so hopefully I will have it this month.
In the mean time, I still soldered one display to the board I have, to
make sure there are no further surprises. It works as expected:
