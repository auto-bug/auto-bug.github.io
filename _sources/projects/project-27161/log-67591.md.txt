# Repository and License
Published on 2017-09-22 in {ref}`project-27161`.

I have put all the shields I made so far in one repository at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/trinket/src](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/trinket/src)  and also added a license, the usual [CC BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) . You will need to install Fritzing to open the files and generate
gerbers from them. 

There also @oshpark links, so that you can order the PCBs from them:


 *  [Trinket TFT](https://oshpark.com/projects/qAgn7BCc) 
 *  [Trinket PWM](https://oshpark.com/projects/UIheamaW)  (untested)
 *  [Trinket LED](https://oshpark.com/projects/5BxdIgQh)  (untested)
 *  [Trinket Buttons](https://oshpark.com/projects/ygVJVBl5)
