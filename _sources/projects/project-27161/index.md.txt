Trinket is a very small (10 pins) microcontroller board made by
Adafruit, originally using an ATtiny85 microcontroller and a
bootloader that allowed programming it over USB. It's perfect for all
those projects that just need a pin or two and some simple logic,
especially when they need to be physically small. Of course due to
very limited resources, you had to program it in C (or Arduino).

Recently Adafruit released a new version of this board, sporting an
ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running CircuitPython. It's the same
size and form-factor as the old Trinket, but now you can simply
program it by editing the Python files on the USB disk that appears
when you plug it in. It's the smallest development board available
that runs Python, and it's super-easy to use. I fell in love from the
first sight with it.

However, searching the Internet, I couldn't find any add-on boards for
it, except for one, that adds LiPO battery charging to it. I have been
making some add-ons for the D1 Mini, so far the smallest Python-
enabled development board on the market, and now that there is a
smaller board available, I decided to make some add-ons for it too.

I already started this with the {ref}`project-27033` , but as I worked on it, I realized that I will need a lot more
shields. I will need one that adds buttons that can be used with that
display, and I will need one that lets me control hobby servos. One
that offers more analog pins would be nice too, and perhaps even
something that enables wireless communication of some kind. They
should all be tiny -- fitting in a one square inch, preferably the
size of the trinket itself -- and they should be stackable as much as
possible.
