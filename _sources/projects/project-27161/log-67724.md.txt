# More Shields
Published on 2017-09-24 in {ref}`project-27161`.

You might have noticed from the previous log that there is a LED
shield and a buttons shield in the works. In fact, I already have the
PCB for the buttons shield, I just need to figure out what resistors
to use for it. I'm still waiting for the PCB for the LED shield.

Today I designed two more: an audio shield, with a small amplifier and
a speaker, connected to the DAC pin of the Trinket M0, and a
prototyping shield, which is just an empty PCB with a lot of empty
holes â€” for quick-and-dirty shields as you need them. I will write
about them more when I get them to work.
