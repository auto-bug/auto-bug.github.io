# Tote Zero
Published on 2016-01-07 in {ref}`project-6050`.

So the boards have arrived and I started working on the [#Tote Zero](/project/9065) , an older brother of Tote, powered by the Pi Zero board. That doesn't
mean Tote is dead or deprecated or anything, of course. I will
continue working on all my project in the same erratic and chaotic
manner I did before.

For instance, one thing I will definitely want to put on Tote is the [#OpenMV](/project/1313)  board -- once they are ready, hopefully sometime this year.
