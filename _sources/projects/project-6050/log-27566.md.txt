# Nothing Happens
Published on 2015-11-05 in {ref}`project-6050`.

I have been a little bit busy with other things recently, and I didn't
update this project for a while, so I thought that it's time to write
something just to let you all know that it's not abandoned.

The progress has been slow, and I don't really have anything finished
to report -- otherwise there would be another log with a full
experiment in it. I did have some success with controlling Tote with a
Raspberry Pi model A+ over IÂ²C, and it should also soon work with a
WiPy board instead of Arduino (I just need to write a servo library
for it, and that requires a stable timer API), but nothing to really
show yet.

Hopefully there will be more updates shortly.
