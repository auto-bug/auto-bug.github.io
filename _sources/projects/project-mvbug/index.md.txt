The excellent OpenMV project gives us an easy way to use a plethora of
visual algorithms in embedded projects by simply calling them from MicroPython
code. It only makes sense to put one of them on my robots. And since I want
to have a specific goal, this robot will act as a work time monitor, making
sure that I take appropriate breaks while working, by monitoring my presence
by the desk.
