# Assembled
Published on 2020-08-14 in {ref}`project-174121`.

The PCBs arrived a while ago, but I was still waiting for the SMD pin
headers. Those arrived today, so I assembled it.

Using those headers for the first time, I'm actually quite happy with
them. The only problem I can see is that the default Fritzing
footprint for them makes the pads really large, so there is a lot of
wiggle room to how they can be soldered — but you need quite precise
positioning for the headers to work with the feather. Soldering
manually is not a problem, because you simply plug a feather into the
headers to make sure the spacing is right. But if I were to have this
assembled in a fab, it would be a problem — possibly using a footprint
with smaller pads would solve that problem.

I also assembled the case from some left-over laser-cut pieces I had
from the previous prototypes. The d-pad and button caps needed some
improvising, I just glued them from several layers. It's not pretty,
but it's good enough for prototyping.

Now I can try and port my games to various exotic feathers. But of
course that involves coding, and that requires much more motivation
than I have, so it will be probably be a while.\
