# PCB
Published on 2020-08-02 in {ref}`project-174121`.

I was ordering PCBs anyways, so I slapped this together quickly. I was
in a hurry, so you will have to excuse me the right angle traces and
somewhat shoddy looks. Since it would be a waste to order a PCB and
not do something new with it, I'm experimenting with SMD pin headers
for the first time here.
