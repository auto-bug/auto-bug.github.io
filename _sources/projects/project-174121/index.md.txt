As the Adafruit Feather form factor of development boards is getting
more and more popular, there are more and more interesting Feathers I
would like to try to make a game console with. NRF54, ESP32S2, Giant
Board, Orange Crab â€” to only mention a few of them. But doing it on a
breadboard is inconvenient, and designing and ordering a PCB for each
new microcontroller takes too long, so I decided to take the PewPew
M4, remove the SAMD51 microcontroller from it, and replace it with
Feather headers, so that I can plug any Feather-compatible board that
has enough pins (sorry HUZZAH).
