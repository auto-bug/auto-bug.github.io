# System Diagram
Published on 2015-08-14.

This is the diagram of my plan to improve the worldwide robot
situation:

I couldn't find a napkin, so instead I sketched it on a block of
paper. Anyways, there are three "input" components. First are the
detailed build instructions for the robot, that account for most of
the hurdles and traps waiting for a beginner roboticist. I'm working
on them at [http://tote.rtfd.org](http://tote.rtfd.org)  and I keep improving them. Then there are the example experiments and
hacks that I publish here at Hackaday.io, that are supposed to inspire
and get people started. And finally we also need a source of
affordable parts, that part is mostly covered by China, but on our
side I need to test and document them too. The expected results are
also three-fold. First, we will see an increase in people who want to
work on robots professionally and make it their career choice. Second,
if enough people are experimenting with this, there are bound to pop
up some discoveries on how to build use those robots. Finally, part of
the energy will come back and improve the project itself, making it
even more effective at those goals.
