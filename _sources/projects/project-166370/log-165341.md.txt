# Why?
Published on 2019-07-04 in {ref}`project-166370`.

Have you ever used one of those tiny 8x8 LED matrices? Have you
noticed anything peculiar about their pinout? Here's something to
refresh your memory:

Not only it's totally random, without a rhyme or reason, but also the
only diagram you have to go by is backwards, giving your pin numbers
in reference to physical locations of the LEDs, instead of giving your
physical locations of the pins in reference to row and column numbers.
Sure, you can work it out on paper, but it's easy to make a mistake.

But don't worry, we have a technological solution to this obvious
problem! Introducing Matrix Sanitizer, which is basically just a tiny
little PCB that rearranges the pins for you into a saner
configuration!

Thanks to years of research of our best engineers, it does it without
any vias, while keeping the same pin spacing, and even lets you insert
the male pin headers without soldering (the matrix still needs to be
soldered for good electrical contact).

The bottom rows are the anodes, and the top row are the cathodes. The
PCB goes flat against the bottom of the matrix, only making it 1.6mm
higher. The resulting contraption fits into a prototyping breadboard
perfectly, and because it uses regular goldpins in place of those
flimsy thin legs, it provides excellent contact.
