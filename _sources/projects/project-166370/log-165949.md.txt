# The Wrong Matrix
Published on 2019-07-20 in {ref}`project-166370`.

Since selling just the PCB would be pretty weird (you can just order
it from @oshpark yourself, and it would be cheaper, considering the
shipping), I ordered a whole bunch of those 20mm matrices [from the usual sources](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1511523876.html) . Unfortunately, when the package arrived today, I had a bit of a
surprise:

I'm holding a 20x20mm, 1.9mm per LED, 788AS matrix. In the box is what
came instead: 32x32mm, 3mm per LED, 1088AS matrices. I'm pretty sure
that is a mistake on their part, since those matrices are much more
expensive, but it's still very annoying.

Now I have several options. I can negotiate with the seller, and maybe
they will replace them — then I'm back to my original plan. I can make
a bigger version of the matrix sanitizer and sell that — but those
bigger matrices don't fit the breadboards as well as the small ones
do. Or I could come up with some other project that utilizes those
matrices, possibly a lot of them all at once. For now I let the seller
know and we will see where that goes.
