# Bi-color Breadboard Adapter
Published on 2019-09-10 in {ref}`project-166370`.

In the spirit of the matrix sanitizer, here's a similar board that
solves a slightly different problem: those bi-color LED matrices that
have three rows of pins are impossible to insert into a breadboard. So
we need something to make it two rows of pins.

This board does that for you. You can order it from [@oshpark](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) :Â  [https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/iOwHMYcW](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/iOwHMYcW) 

I'm particularly happy that I managed to make it one-layer and
symmetric.
