# Rubber Paint and Blue Smoke
Published on 2014-12-06 in {ref}`project-3301`.

While I still didn't get to get the camera modules to stream any
video, I worked a little bit on the servo controller and mechanical
parts of the robot.

For one, I discovered why all the frequencies were half what I
expected from the code -- I selected the 5V, not 3.3V board in the
Arduino IDE, so the code was compiled for the wrong model. Selecting
the right board fixes all those issues.

Another thing is the voltage monitor. I added a simple voltage divider
on two resistors, and connected it to one of the analog pins on the
servo controller. Now I can shut down the servos if the battery
voltage reaches a critical level.

I also painted the servo horns at the ends of the legs with some
rubber paint, hoping that will let them get a better grip on the
floor. Unfortunately, it seems to have very little effect.

Finally, when testing the new servo controller code, I must have
shorted one of the cables, and my servo controller released blue
smoke. As you all know, those electronic components are actually
powered by magical blue smoke inside, and if you release it, they stop
working. I'm considering using a 5V one now, because I've run out of
3.3V replacements...

Update: So, after some research, it turns out that the part that got
fried is... the on/off switch. Phew. That's literally the cheapest
part, so I'm lucky.
