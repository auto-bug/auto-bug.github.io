# Camera Works!
Published on 2015-01-08 in {ref}`project-3301`.

Finally, I got the streaming from camera to work! Look:

The video is rotated by 90Â° and quite slow, but that's details that I
can handle. The trick was to use an older version of mjpeg-streamer
that doesn't segfault in YUV mode.

I also worked on the physical body of the robot a little bit. Instead
of a transparent piece of plastic with everything glued to it, I now
have a prototype board with a bunch of sockets and all the wires
connecting them. The VoCore, Arduino, camera and battery just plug
into that. And the PCB is exactly the right size to serve as a lid for
a transparent plastic box. I just have to shave a couple of mm off the
top of the camera module...
