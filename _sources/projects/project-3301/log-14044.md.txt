# Still Alive
Published on 2015-02-13 in {ref}`project-3301`.

The progress on this guy has been kind of slow, and mostly in
software. The current status is that I have the video streaming from
camera to the web browser working, and I resolved the issue with noise
on the serial line that made it impossible for the robot to walk
properly (it turned out to be some kernel logs still being output to
the serial). There still seems to be some problem either with the leg
inverse kinematics, or the walking algorithm, as the legs move a
little strange -- this requires further investigation.

I also have no idea for the control scheme. Right now I just start the
micropython script from the command line over ssh, but it would be
nice to be able to control the robot interactively, possibly through
the web page that includes the streamed video. There is a socket
library in micropython, so I could just listen for commands on some
port, but from JavaScript I can only do HTTP or websocket
communication... I need to think about it some more.

As for the twin brother, I'm trying to program it entirely in Arduino,
so that it's the cheapest quadruped robot around. If that works, I
will add a basic "laser tag" gun to it and try to talk some friends
into making their own version, so that we can have a cheap version of
the Mech Warfare battles. It will probably be a separate project,
though.\
