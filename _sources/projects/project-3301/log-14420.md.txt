# Minimal Version Improved
Published on 2015-02-23 in {ref}`project-3301`.

So I worked a little bit on the gait of the minimal version, and also
added a piezo buzzer and some sounds (after a while I made it start up
muted, the sounds need to be explicitly enabled with the remote, as
they are quite annoying). You can also turn while walking and rotate
in place, adjust the height of the robot and the spread of its legs,
etc.
