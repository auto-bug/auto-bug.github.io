# VoCore+Webcam
Published on 2014-11-22 in {ref}`project-3301`.

I have the servo controller working, with all the servos trimmed and
reversed to the right base positions. I should be able to get it to
walk by controlling it over TTL2USB from the computer.

In the meantime, I got the UART on VoCore to work the way I wanted.
Next thing is to get it to work with the laptop camera module over
USB. Right now I got it to actually see the camera device and load the
right kernel drivers for it. Running mjpg-streamer switches the LED on
the camera on, and I can go to the website to see the stream... Except
all the frames have 0 bytes, and the driver crashes as soon as I stop
the streamer.
