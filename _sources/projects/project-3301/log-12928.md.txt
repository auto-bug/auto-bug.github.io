# My First PCB
Published on 2015-01-14 in {ref}`project-3301`.

The whole robot building thing is supposed to be a learning
experience. So after fumbling with the wires and prototype boards for
a while, I decided it's time to try and design an printed circuit
board for the robot. The advantage, apart from much better handling
the tiny 1.27mm spacing, would be that it could also double as a base
for the robot.

After trying my skills with a number of available PCB-designing
software (Egale and KiCad, among others), I finally decided to use...
Fritzing. Maybe it's not as advanced as the others, but at least has
user interface from this millennium, and can generate Gerber files
without too much hassle. It's also the only one where I found how to
place elements on the board and connect them first, and then create
the schematic -- which is much better if I have a choice for using
multiple pins for the same thing, and can choose the closest one. It
also already came with an Arduino Pro Mini footprint.

The board is pretty simple, it's just has a place to put your Arduino
in, and sockets for the servos. There is also room for a big
capacitor, a power switch, a battery voltage monitoring circuit, and
an optional IR receiver. It can then use just the Arduino for some
simple behaviors, or have something smarter (like the VoCore)
connected through the UART or IÂ²C.
