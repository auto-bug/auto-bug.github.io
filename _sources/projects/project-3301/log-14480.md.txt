I finally got to rebuilding the VoCore version of pKubik using the new
printed circuit board. On the photo, starting from the top, you can
see:


 * a hat
 * battery charging module
 * camera module
 * battery
 * VoCore
 * breakout board for the VoCore
 * Arduino Pro Mini
 * the new board.

I also compiled a new OpenWRT image for it, and made sure everything
works as it did before. So now I am where I was a week ago, except
with a sturdier and more modular construction.

I also have the gait implementation I wrote for the Arduino-only
version, and I'm tempted to drop the Micropython version. Instead just
accept commands for the Arduino-controlled gait on the serial, and
echo those through ssh from the VoCore.

Oh, I also finally found a good source of rubber for the feet. Old-
school bicycle valves used pieces of a small rubber hose. You can
still buy them in bike shops today, and they make excellent feet for
the robots.
