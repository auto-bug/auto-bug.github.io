# Vocore
Published on 2014-11-17 in {ref}`project-3301`.

My vocore boards finally arrived. They are so tiny!

So far not much done. I have tested one of the boards, ssh'd into it,
installed the Micropython packages on it from the OpenWRT
repositories, got TTL to work, tested that the interactive shell
works.

Next I will need to experiment with GPIOs and PWM on it, see if I can
get it to control the servos directly. In the worst case, I will just
connect a 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini over TTL as the servo controller, but
I'm optimistic.

The PyBoard will probably get moved to a slightly bigger robot body.
