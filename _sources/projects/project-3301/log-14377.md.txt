So here's the minimal version of the robot -- only the servos, an
Arduino and an IR sensor for control with a TV remote. The gait still
needs a little bit of tweaking (and I didn't adjust the trims on the
servos), but it still walks pretty well. I also need to add rotation.

This can be used as is, bascially a remote-controlled toy, or you can
attach various things to the Arduino (both the serial and the IÂ²C pins
are free) to control it in a little bit more intelligent way (like the
VoCore + webcam version that I started with). In particular, I'm
looking forward to getting that OpenMV board to put it on this thing.
