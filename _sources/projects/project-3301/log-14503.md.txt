# Exploring Under the Table
Published on 2015-02-26 in {ref}`project-3301`.

So, it seems to be a good decision to use the working gait code from
Arduino, and just send high-level commands over the serial to it. At
least it gave me a working robot.

Below you can see it exploring my room with its webcam. It's a little
dark under the table, and my screen's refresh rate interferes with the
camera, but it feels almost like Doom.
