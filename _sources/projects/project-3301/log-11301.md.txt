# Walking Controlled from PC
Published on 2014-11-24 in {ref}`project-3301`.

With very little progress with the camera (I can make shots with_fswebcam_, but when streaming with_mjpg-stream_, all frames are empty), I decided to go back to the mechanical part
and see if it actually walks. I measured the legs, put it all into the [inverse kinematics](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/pkubik/src/f0c05b8506bea5cfca37cf0ce62996a7dcb6a0cf/robot.py)  and copied the code for the creep gait from [ÂµKubik](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/pkubik/src/f0c05b8506bea5cfca37cf0ce62996a7dcb6a0cf/creep.py) . Turned out I need to do some more fine-tuning of the trim and
reverse settings in my servo controller, but it finally walked:

It's still pretty slow, and the cable makes it unbalanced, but the
basic idea is there.\


Now back to getting the camera to work. In the worst case I guess I
will just stream the shots made with_fswebcam_... I wish I had [OpenMV](http://hackaday.io/project/1313-openmv)  for this robot brains.
