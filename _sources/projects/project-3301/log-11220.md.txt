# Servo Controller
Published on 2014-11-19 in {ref}`project-3301`.

After looking at the PWM library for Vocore ( [http://vonger.cn/?topic=pwm-is-running-at-gpios](http://vonger.cn/?topic=pwm-is-running-at-gpios) ) and trying to actually solder more than 2 wires to its tiny 1.27mm
headers, I decided that I don't want to drive those servos directly
from Vocore. I need a servo controller. A 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini clone
will do quite well for that, with a very simple sketch for setting the
servo positions by TTL ( [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/pkubik/src/tip/controller/](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/pkubik/src/tip/controller/) ).

This way I can test the mechanical part of the robot already, by
talking to it over USB2TTL from the computer, and then add Vocore and
use one of its two UARTs for the same thing. Writing to a tty file
should be easier than a PWM driver.\


One problem now, though. Arduino's Servo.h library worked perfectly on
the 5V Pro Minis that I used before, but it seems to have some
problems on the 3.3V one. Either the library is sensitive to the CPU
speed change, or the board is simply not fast enough to drive all the
12 servos. Or I simply have some silly mistake in there.

Update: Seems like just halving the pulse width does the trick.
