# New Camera
Published on 2014-12-05 in {ref}`project-3301`.

I decided to get the mjpg streaming working by using a different
camera module. This one comes from an Asus laptop and is called
MT9M112. The cables didn't take long to figure out: the black and
brown are VCC, the silver and green are GND, and the orange and red
are USB+ and USB-, respectively. The camera needs the gspca_stk1135
kernel driver, which means that I will have to compile a new kernel
for VoCore again.

The first surprise -- the OpenWRT's menuconfig command doesn't let me
choose the gspca_stk1135 module. I suppose it's a recent addition, and
needs to be enabled manually. We'll see if it works on this
architecture at all.

Second surprise -- I forgot that flashing OpenWRT image resets the
root password to "unset", and since I disabled the serial console to
be able to use the serial for the servo controller, I have no way to
log in. Now I have to flash a new image using the slow method, over
kermit.

At least the camera is slightly shorter, so it will fit better on the
front of the robot.

UPDATE: Nope, the new camera doesn't support mjpg either, and the YUV
mode also segfaults with it.
