# Battery Life
Published on 2015-03-02 in {ref}`project-3301`.

I get a lot of questions about how long can those tiny robots go on a
single battery charge. And I never know what to say, because it
depends on what they are doing and the calculations are difficult. So
I decided to try and see.

I've set the pure-arduino one, with 180mAh battery, to walk around the
table leg in circles at full speed (which is actually pretty slow,
with its tiny short legs), and waited until the battery overcharge
protection kicked it.

Took exactly 20 minutes -- which is what I gave as a guesstimate to
the people before.

I also noticed one nice thing in the process. The robot kept on
walking around that table leg, and repeated the same circle for those
20 minutes, without spiraling away in any direction, as I expected it
to. This means that whatever inaccuracies it has in its measurements,
leg inverse kinematics calculations and mechanical skewing of legs,
they are all relatively constant and repeatable. That bodes well for
implementing navigation for it.

Now I need to make a similar test with the VoCore version, with video
streaming running. The VoCore can suck up to 300mA, but that one has a
350mAh battery, so maybe the time will be similar...\


UPDATE: 21 minutes with low-resolution streaming, walking in circles.
