# PyBoard
Published on 2014-11-13 in {ref}`project-3301`.

The pyboard has arrived, so I quickly made a servo shield for it, and
tested the servos first with the pyb.Servo and then directly with
pyb.Timer. Both seem to be working fine.

You can see that I had to make some adapters for the servo plugs. The
pyboard uses 2.54 raster, and so does the servo breakout board, while
the servo plugs and sockets have 1.27 raster.

I'm still waiting for VoCore to test it too. It's smaller, has 1.27
raster, runs actual Linux, includes WiFi and an USB host that I could
use to connect a camera module from a laptop -- so overall, much more
interesting to me. I can see that they got PWM to work on the GPIO
pins, so it should be workable...
