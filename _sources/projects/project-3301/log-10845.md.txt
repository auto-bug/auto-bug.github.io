# Deciding on the brains
Published on 2014-11-02 in {ref}`project-3301`.

I'm still waiting for the brains of this thing to arrive. It's going
to be either a Vocore board, with the UNIX version of the Micropython
running on top of OpenWRT, and possibly a Pro Mini for the servo
controller, or the original PyBoard. The OpenMV project looks like it
would be perfect for this, but it's not available yet.

I really hope that I will get it to work with Vocore, because that
would mean I have WiFi and USB host -- so a possibility of connecting
some laptop webcam module to it.
