# More Blue Smoke
Published on 2014-12-23 in {ref}`project-3301`.

Today is a sad day for this project.

I decided to use a new battery that I bought specially for this robot,
instead of using battery packs from my Walkera RC helicopter. Taught
with previous mistakes, I have a socket for the battery that only lets
you insert the plug the correct way. Being assured by this, I didn't
really look carefully when I connected the battery... Alerted by the
hissing and smoke from the power switch, I immediately disconnected it
but... too late.\


What happened? Look at this:

See? Battery packs from different manufacturers have the plugs in
reverse... I suppose that increases their sales.

Unfortunately, this time not only the power switch is fried -- also
the VoCore. The Arduino Pro Mini and the camera module seem to be
fine, though.
