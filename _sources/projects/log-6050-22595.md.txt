# New New Board in the Wild
Published on 2015-08-12.

So the version 4 printed circuit boards arrived a few days ago (no,
that's not super-fast shipping from China, I just waited several weeks
before even writing about them). I'm almost perfectly happy with them,
so far I only came up with two small things I want to change. Probably
not enough to make another version.

This time the board is bigger and the servo horns are not attached
diagonally -- they fit within the board. The holes for the horns
should be a little bit larger (depends on what servos you get, some of
them fit perfectly) and not metalized, but that's something you can
fix easily with a file. The board on the photo has all the parts
soldered on one side of the board -- because I want to have the Pro
Mini pluggable there. It's possible to also put the servo sockets and
capacitor below, and have the top of the robot almost flat, then make
use of all those mounting holes.

The finished robot is quite nice, and it's sturdier than the previous
versions. Also much easier to assemble. I still need to fine-tune the
leg positions on this one, and add the IR sensor.
