# Got PCBs, Waiting on Chips
Published on 2017-10-19 in {ref}`project-27566`.

The prototype PCBs from OSHPark arrived today, but I'm still waiting
for the chips. However, I just got an e-mail notification that the
package with the chips arrived in my country, so they should get here
tomorrow. Of course I will also need a library for this, but it should
be trivial.
