# Assembled PCB
Published on 2018-06-26 in {ref}`project-158981`.

I assembled a second PCB, this time without first breaking off all the
bits of the legs, to see how it will look and feel. I actually had to
break off one piece, to get to the USB port.

However, if I'm going to sell those, I think I will break all the bits
off, and put it all in a bag. It will be smaller that way, and less
fragile.

I still can't decide whether I want to ship with the battery holder
and servo headers soldered or not. Having them soldered allows people
to more easily assemble it, but makes the package thicker, and makes
cable management tricky. If the headers are not soldered, they can cut
the servo cables to the right length and solder them directly into the
board, like I did with the first prototype:

On the other hand, since the battery holder has its cross-section
roughly square anyways, the package has to be pretty thick to fit it
no matter if it's soldered or not.
