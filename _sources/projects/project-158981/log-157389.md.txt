# Immediate Plans
Published on 2018-12-21 in {ref}`project-158981`.

I had a bit of a break with this project, while I worked on other
projects and dealt with some life stuff, but I very much still want to
work on it. Obviously the very next step that needs to be done is to
program the robot to do actual walking, at least at the level of {ref}`project-6050` , and then possibly make use of the accelerometer and the leg
switches. I assume that this will actually take me some time. In the
mean time, CircuitPython is being developed further and ported to the
NRF52 chip, growing bluetooth support along the way, so the long-term
plan is to switch to NRF52 from the SAMD21 chip. That will probably
involve a redesign of the extension connector as well, so I don't
think I will be working on any extensions until that happens.

Once the connector design is finalized, it will be time to look at
possible extensions and the sensors to include on them. I want to have
an OpenMV adapter, and also a simple "face" with distance sensors on
it.
