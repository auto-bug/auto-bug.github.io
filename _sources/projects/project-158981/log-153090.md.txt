# Build Instructions
Published on 2018-09-20 in {ref}`project-158981`.

Since there is now at least one person trying to build this robot, I'd
better post some build instructions. I don't have a full-blown
material with photos yet, but I will try to make it workable.

So, first, what you will need:


 * the assembled robot PCB, with the battery holder
 * 12 SG90 microservos
 * 24 tiny screws (I forgot to attach them to the PCB, sorry)
 * 4 larger screws (you can use the ones that come with the servos)

To assemble the legs, first hot-glue four pairs of servos together to
form the hips. You will need two "left" and two "right" pairs. The
whole leg goes something like this:

And two of them will be a mirror image of that. Don't put in the
screws that hold the servo horns, you will need to adjust the servo
positions first.

Connect the servos to the PCB. There are helpful markings on it, such
as "FR1" (front right 1) and "HL3" (hind left 3). The number goes 1
for ankle, 2 for knee and 3 for hip. The ground pin is marked, the
middle pin is power, and the last pin is signal. You can use male pin
headers and plug the servos in, or cut the cables and solder them
directly. I prefer the latter, because then you can adjust the wire
length and have better cable management. Make sure to leave some extra
cable length for the leg to be able to move freely.

Once you have that, you can connect the robot to USB and create a [main.py](http://main.py)  file with the following contents:


```python
import board
import pulseio
import time


_PINS = (
        board.SERVO_HL1, board.SERVO_HL2, board.SERVO_HL3,
        board.SERVO_FR1, board.SERVO_FR2, board.SERVO_FR3,
        board.SERVO_FL1, board.SERVO_FL2, board.SERVO_FL3,
        board.SERVO_HR1, board.SERVO_HR2, board.SERVO_HR3,
)
servos = tuple(
    pulseio.PWMOut(pin, frequency=75)
    for pin in _PINS
)
for servo in servos:
    time.sleep(0.25)
    servo.duty_cycle = 6300

while True:
    time.sleep(1)

```

That will set all the servos to their middle positions. Disconnect the
robot, insert the battery (mind the polarization) and switch the robot
on. Now remove each servo from its horn and insert it back, making
sure it's at a right angle to the horn. Secure the horns with the
screws.

That gives you a finished physical robot.

I still didn't write the programs and libraries for it — I will be
writing updates here when I do.
