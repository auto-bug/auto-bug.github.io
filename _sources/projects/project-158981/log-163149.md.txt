# Reevaluating the Feasibility
Published on 2019-05-09 in {ref}`project-158981`.

I compiled a custom CircuitPython firmware with all the pins exposed,
and ran a simple program looking for any combination of pins that
would give me 12 PWM outputs:


```python
for permutation in permutations(pins):
    pwms = []
    for pin in permutation:
        try:
            pwms.append(pulseio.PWMOut(pin, frequency=50))
        except (RuntimeError, ValueError):
            pass
    if len(pwms) > 10:
        print(pwms)
    for pwm in pwms:
        pwm.deinit()
```

Yes, I know, I could have checked the datasheet for timers instead,
but this is easier and makes more more certain.

That's a lot of permutations to check, so it took some time, but
ultimately it came up empty. There is no permutation that would give
me more than 10 PWM outputs on the  SAMD21E18A chip. So what other
options do I have now?\


I could use a SAMD21G18A that has 38 GPIO pins — I'm sure they come
with some extra timers that would enable a few extra PWMs. But
the SAMD21E18A costs $2.38 in singles, while SAMD21G18A costs $3.47.
That increase in price wouldn't be that bad by itself, however, for
$4.01 I can have a SAMD51G19A instead, and a PCA9685 costs a dollar.

So now I have several options:


 * SAMD21E18A + PCA9685 — $3.38
 * SAMD21G18A — $3.47
 * SAMD51G19A — $4.01

But it's not just about the price, is it? The SAMD51 is a massively
more powerful microcontroller, with *much* more RAM, faster clock and
more flash. Also hardware floating point operations and a bunch of
other stuff. And that is for just $2 more. I really think that it's
the best option. Besides, I've been wanting to make a board with that
microcontroller for a while, but since {ref}`project-86818` is on hold, I didn't really have a chance. On top of that, I have one
already in my drawer, so no need to wait for parts (though I will
still need to wait for the PCB).
