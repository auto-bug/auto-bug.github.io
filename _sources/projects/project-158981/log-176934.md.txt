# Progress
Published on 2020-05-04 in {ref}`project-158981`.

I have spent the whole Sunday re-doing the PCB design, and then adding
battery protection, charging and a speaker with amplifier. It looks
like this now:

And then I realized that the puny SAMD21 is not going to have enough
memory to make use of this â€” at the very least I will need external
flash. And I might as well switch to the SAMD51 at this point, since
it's not that much more expensive. That also gives me more pins, so I
can have a proper feather pinout plus all the servos and plus some
extra stuff. However, I will need to completely re-do the design for
that, so it will probably wait until the next weekend.
