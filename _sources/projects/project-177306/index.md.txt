    The {ref}`project-159733` is optimized for cost, and since that means that you want to do as
little soldering as possible, it uses a ready LED matrix as a single
component. However, if you instead use discrete LEDs, replace the
buttons with touch pads, the USB socket with a 0.6mm thick PCB cutout
and drop the battery and power switch, you can get something really
thin â€” below 2mm total. Something that could possibly be used as a
business card.
