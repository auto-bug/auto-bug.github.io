# The Prototype
Published on 2021-02-05 in {ref}`project-177306`.

It took longer than anticipated, but with checking after each diode, I
finally managed to get all of them properly soldered without any
shorts. Then I made a branch of CircuitPython with the right code, and
here it is:

I must say I'm not entirely happy about it. Due to changes in
CircuitPython 5.x, the interrupts are not as stable as they used to
be, and you can see the LEDs flickering a little, which is annoying.
Lack of a diffuser also makes it look worse than the very first
version of {ref}`project-21578` with the bi-color matrix.

The touch pads are tricky. The direction pads are a bit too close
together and it's hard to use them â€” it's expected, but there simply
isn't more space on the PCB for it. At the same time, despite my
efforts to route the traces for the touch pads out of the way, it's
easy to accidentally touch them on them back of the PCB.

Generally, considering the huge amount of work needed to get this
working, and the rather mediocre end result, I think I will stop with
this prototype and not pursue this more. It was a good experiment, but
I think the end result is not great.
