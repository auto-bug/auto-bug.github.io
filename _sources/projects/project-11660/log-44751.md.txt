# ÂµDisplay -- Drivers for 6 Different RGB Displays
Published on 2016-08-28 in {ref}`project-11660`.

This is a collection of 6 different displays drivers for TFT and OLED
RGB displays. I finally took the time to refactor all my drivers, pull
out the common parts, and put them all in a single library. Don't
worry, each driver is in a separate file, so you can copy only the
parts that you are actually using onto your board.
