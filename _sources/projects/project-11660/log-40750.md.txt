# PCA9685 PWM Driver
Published on 2016-06-27 in {ref}`project-11660`.

This chip is actually used in two different modules. First it's used
in the 16-channel IÂ²C servo (and LED) drivers. Second, it's also used
in Adafruit's motor shield. That's why apart from the main module,
which lets you control the chip directly, there are also two others,
specifically for the servos and the DC motors.
