# DS1307, DS3231, and PCF8523 Real-Time Clocks
Published on 2016-08-17 in {ref}`project-11660`.

Here's a library for handling a bunch of popular I2C-based real-time
clock chips: [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-uRTC](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-uRTC) 

And here is the documentation for it: [http://micropython-urtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://micropython-urtc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

As you can guess from the naming, I was supported by Adafruit
Industries to write this one (but of course it will work with any
breakout boards for those chips, not just theirs). I will most likely
create more libraries for them.
