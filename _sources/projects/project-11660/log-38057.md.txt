# HT16K33 LED Matrix Backpack
Published on 2016-05-15 in {ref}`project-11660`.

The Adafruit LED matrix backpacks use the HT16K33 chip for I²C
communication and driving the LEDs. I wrote a simple library for
Micropython for handling those. The source code is at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-
ht16k33/src/tip/ht16k33_matrix.py](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-ht16k33/src/tip/ht16k33_matrix.py) 

The library is very basic, it lets you fill the whole matrix, clear
it, or set individual pixels on it. It should run on any platform that
runs MicroPython and has I²C communication. Both 8x8 and 16x8 matrices
are supported.

Example code:


```python
from machine import I2C, Pin
from ht16k33_matrix import Matrix8x8

i2c = I2C(sda=Pin(4), scl=Pin(5))
display = Matrix8x8(i2c)

display.brightness(8)
display.blink_rate(2)
display.fill(True)
display.pixel(0, 0, False)
display.pixel(7, 0, False)
display.pixel(0, 7, False)
display.pixel(7, 7, False)
display.show()
```

Update: thanks to Adafruit's support I now added the bi-color matrix
to the library.
