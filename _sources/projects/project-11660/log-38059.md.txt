# VL6180 Optical Time-o-Flight Distance Sensor
Published on 2016-05-15 in {ref}`project-11660`.

The VL6180 is a very small, pretty accurate, IÂ²C-based distance
sensor. And it can also measure ambient light. I wrote a simple
library for Micropython for talking with it, mostly based on the
Sparkfun's Arduino library. The code is at: [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-vl6180/src/tip/vl6180.py](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-vl6180/src/81f6e7a5b2b231ba5bbd8d56156c1e2fc1bcb834/vl6180.py) 

Note that this library uses the new I2C interface, which is currently
available on Micropython for the ESP8266. It should eventually be
available on all Micropython ports, though.

Example:


```python
import time
from machine import I2C, Pin
from vl6180 import Sensor

i2c = I2C(sda=Pin(4), scl=Pin(5))
sensor = Sensor(i2c)

print(sensor.range())
```
