# IS31FL3731 Charlie-Plexed LED Matrix
Published on 2016-07-09 in {ref}`project-11660`.

This driver is for a monochromatic matrix of up to 144 LEDs, with
hardware PWM and blinking. It also has 8 frames of memory, and can
fade between them, or play animations with them -- optionally
synchronized to music! The code is at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-
is31fl3731/src/tip/is31fl3731.py](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-is31fl3731/src/tip/is31fl3731.py) 

Example use:


```python
import is31fl3731
from machine import I2C, Pin
i2c = I2C(Pin(5), Pin(4))
display = is31fl3731.CharlieWing(i2c)
display.fill(127)
display.pixel(0, 0, 2, True)
display.blink(540)
```
