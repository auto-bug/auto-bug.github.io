# ILI9340/ILI9341 TFT Display
Published on 2016-06-05 in {ref}`project-11660`.

Those displays are quite popular and common, so I made a driver for
them. Right now the driver is very basic, only gives the ability to
draw individual pixels or filled rectangles. It's also pretty slow, at
least with the bit-banged SPI on the ESP8266. The code is at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-ili9341/src/](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-ili9341/src/) 

Update: now also added text and vertical scrolling.

Update: implemented HSPI on the ESP8266 and it's now blazing fast.
