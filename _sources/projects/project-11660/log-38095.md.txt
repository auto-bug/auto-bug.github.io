# RC Hobby Servos
Published on 2016-05-16 in {ref}`project-11660`.

This is a very simple library for controlling up to eight hobby servos
with Micropython on ESP8266. The limitation of eight servos comes from
the fact that only 8 pins have PWM supported currently, and this is
just a simple wrapper over the PWM functionality. The code is at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-servo/src/tip/servo.py](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-servo/src/tip/servo.py) 

Note that to use pins gpio0, gpio2 and gpio15, you need to add
appropriate pull-up or pull-down resistors, to make the board boot
into the correct mode despite having the servos connected.
