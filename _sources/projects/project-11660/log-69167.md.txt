# OLED Displays
Published on 2017-10-17 in {ref}`project-11660`.

The code is at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-oled/overview](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-oled/overview) 

See the README for explanation and examples.

This time I wrote drivers for something that mostly already had its
drivers in MicroPython — the monochrome OLED displays. I did that,
because I wasn't happy with the existing drivers — they are a bit
elaborate in terms of indirection and inheritance. Sure, code reuse
and so on, but not very nice for constrained platforms. So I did my
own, trying to optimize them. I also exposed some useful functions,
like flipping and hardware scrolling.

I will hopefully add some more exotic displays there, as I get
specimen to test on.
