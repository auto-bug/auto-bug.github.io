# 1.2V and Version 2
Published on 2021-12-03 in {ref}`project-182342`.

Today the correct 1.2V LDO arrived, so I replaced it on the shield,
replaced the camera sensor (in case I fried this one with the
incorrect 1.5V) and tried again. And... nothing again.

With the help of Jeff Epler, I checked the signals on various pins,
and as far as my toy scope can tell, they are all correct. In other
words, it should all work, but somehow doesn't.

Next I'm going to look for a different example, not involving
CircuitPython, to see if maybe that will work. I also have a Chinese
module with the same camera, that I want to try.

In any case, the shield doesn't seem to need any electrical fixes, so
I went ahead and ordered the second version, with slightly nicer
traces, and i2c pins in a more traditional place â€” so it can be used
together with other shields.
