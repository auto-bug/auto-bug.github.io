# Version 1 PCB
Published on 2021-10-25 in {ref}`project-182342`.

This is the first attempt at this shield, and it's mostly based on
guesswork, datasheet, schematic for the ESP32 Cam board, and some bad
quality images of the pinouts I found online. I have absolutely no
idea if it will work, but I can try. The design is pretty dense:

I didn't feel like fixing the angles of all the traces, so you will
have to suffer. The render doesn't look bad:

There are two voltage regulators, each with its own capacitor, two
resistors for I2C pull-ups, a resistor to pull-down the enable pin on
the camera, and a 14pF capacitor on the PCLK line, no idea why, but
ESP32 Cam had it, so I copied it. And of course the camera socket
itself, which is a fun 0.5mm-pitch footprint.
