# Camera in CircuitPython
Published on 2021-10-29 in {ref}`project-182342`.

There is ongoing work being done by Jeff Epler to bring the cameras to
CircuitPython. There is an excellent tutorial available here:  [https://learn.adafruit.com/capturing-camera-images-with-circuitpython](https://learn.adafruit.com/capturing-camera-images-with-circuitpython) 

But this is not all. Right now Jeff is working on a way to produce
animated GIF images directly from the camera, and save them to the SD
card.

There is also a way to stream the video:  [https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-webcam-with-ov2640](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-webcam-with-ov2640) 

So I'm confident that even if my own software experiments fail, the
shield will still prove useful.
