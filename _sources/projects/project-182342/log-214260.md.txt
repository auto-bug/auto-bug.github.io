# More Frustration
Published on 2022-12-14 in {ref}`project-182342`.

So I figured out the display problem – I connected the (unused) reset
pin to the camera's master clock pin by mistake, so the display was
being reset at 16MHz... After fixing that, I finally got an image on
the screen:

That... doesn't look like any swapped pins. To my untrained eye it
looks like simply empty unintialized memory. Could it be that it
"works" in the 16MHz mode simply because it does nothing? I tried
switching it back to 20MHz, and now I'm getting a suspicious
exception:


```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "code.py", line 45, in 
TypeError: unsupported bitmap type

```

So it looks like the bitmap type changes depending on the clock
frequency? How does that even make any sense? Madness!
