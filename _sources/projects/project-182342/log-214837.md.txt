# Everything Works!
Published on 2022-12-31 in {ref}`project-182342`.

The PCBs arrived in the break between holidays, and I got to assemble
one of each. First the Raspberry Pi Pico shield:

I tried it without the crystal first, with a bodge wire to a free pin
to generate the master clock with PWM. Once I had it verified working
that way, I removed the bodge and soldered the 24MHz crystal, and it
works flawlessly. Then I moved on to the S2 Mini shield:

I tested the previous version of this with the crystal connected with
bodge wires, and it didn't work, so I had very little hope for this,
but turns out it was the fault of the bodge wires, and it works
perfectly fine with the crystal soldered on the PCB.

I think that this pretty much concludes the project. I will make the
design files available, and that's it.
