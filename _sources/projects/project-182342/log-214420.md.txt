# Version 4 and MooCam
Published on 2022-12-18 in {ref}`project-182342`.

Since I was ordering PCBs anyways, I went ahead and added the version
4 of the shield, with the footprint fot the oscillator added, to the
order:

Nothing really exciting there. I also ordered the oscillators, and
they should arrive shortly, so we will see how well this works.

The pull request for making the xclk pin optional got merged to
CircuitPython, so that should work once version 8.0 is released.

I also had a stab at a similar shield for the Raspberry Pi Pico and
Pico W. It's an excellent moment for it, since the Raspberry Pi
Foundation loves surveillance so much â€“ they should be more than happy
that their corrupted government is getting more tools to make sure
nobody harbors Unapproved Opinions.

Since there was room, and since extra storage might be useful with a
camera, I also added a microSD card socket in there, and a button for
the shutter on the front side, together with a police star.

We will see how all that works, but unless I made some horrible
mistakes, it should work.
