# Great Success
Published on 2022-12-15 in {ref}`project-182342`.

Last time I gave up on the ESP32-S2, so today I decided to see how
this camera works with the RP2040 instead. That uses a different
library, called imagecapture, and since that library makes the master
clock pin optional, I decided to first try with an off-the-shelf
module that I have, which I couldn't use previously, because it
doesn't expose the master clock pin – it has a crystal oscillator on
board for this.

I got everything connected, I copied the example code, and... it just
works, as advertised. Wow.

But wait, does that mean my shield is faulty? Let's connect it and
see!

This time it didn't work as great – I got some data from the JPEG
mode, but when I saved it in a file, it wasn't recognized as a JPEG
file. So I looked closely. A normal JPEG file starts with bytes ff d8
ff e0 00, but the data I got starts with ff e8 ff d0 00 – the e8 and
d8 are swapped! But how? Well, e8 is 11101000 in binary, and d8 is
11011000 – could it be I have two data pins swapped? I tried swapping
them back, and lo and behold – a correct JPEG image file popped out!

Could it be that was my problem all along? The diagram telling which
pin is which on the camera was wrong? After all, datasheets have
mistakes in them. So I quickly went back to the S2 Mini to see if my
shield works after all if I swap the two pins. I connected everything
back and... nothing. As before the 16MHz clock returns unintialized
memory, and the 20MHz clock just sits there waiting for data
indefinitely.

So I went through the pins one more time, and I discovered that the
stickers that I got with my S2 Mini boards, with pin numbers on them
have the pins 12 and 13 swapped. And it just so happens I was using
pin 12 as the pixel clock. Except I had it s pin 13 in my code,
because of the mistake in the sticker. Changing it to 12 suddenly made
everything work (with the 20MHz master clock, the 16MHz is still
broken). Both the RGB565 and the JPEG modes work perfectly!

I can't even say how happy that makes me. This shield was a lot of
frustration, and it the end it all turned out to be due to mistakes in
pin numbering.

Here is the working code, if anybody is interested:


```
import adafruit_ili9341
import busio
import digitalio
import esp32_camera


displayio.release_displays()
display_bus = displayio.FourWire(
    busio.SPI(clock=board.IO7, MOSI=board.IO5),
    command=board.IO9,
    chip_select=board.IO3,
    baudrate=80_000_000,
)
display = adafruit_ili9341.ILI9341(
    display_bus,
    width=320,
    height=240,
)

i2c = busio.I2C(scl=board.IO35, sda=board.IO33)
data_pins = (
    board.IO21, board.IO17, board.IO16, board.IO18,
    board.IO37, board.IO34, board.IO36, board.IO39,
)
c = esp32_camera.Camera(
    data_pins=data_pins,
    external_clock_pin=board.IO11,

    frame_size=esp32_camera.FrameSize.QVGA,
    i2c=i2c,
    external_clock_frequency=20_000_000,
)

g = displayio.Group()
bitmap = None
while not bitmap:
    bitmap = c.take()
shader = displayio.ColorConverter(
    input_colorspace=displayio.Colorspace.BGR565_SWAPPED
)
tg = displayio.TileGrid(bitmap, pixel_shader=shader)
g.append(tg)
display.show(g)
display.auto_refresh = False
while True:
    bitmap = c.take()
    tg.x = 1 # make the grid dirty
    tg.x = 0
    display.refresh()
```
