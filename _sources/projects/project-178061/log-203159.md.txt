# Restarting
Published on 2022-02-14 in {ref}`project-178061`.

I put this project on hold last time, but somehow I couldn't let go of
the ideas, so now I'm back. As mentioned previously, the experiments
with parallel display didn't work very well, and I have given up on
that — but that same display is also available with an SPI interface —
named Z320IT010 — and with a faster SPI clock of the ESP32-S2, it
might still work well enough. I would use my  {ref}`project-80626` , which now has the option of scaling the display up, and not the slow
displayio.

I also decided to take a step back from designing a "product" that can
be assembled by a fab house, and instead make a prototype that can be
easily made at home. This, among other things, means using a
development board, which simplifies everything considerably.

Finally, I decided to try the portrait orientation. I went ahead and
ordered the first PCB:

We will see how well that works.
