# On Hold
Published on 2021-06-11 in {ref}`project-178061`.

Since my experiments show that using the parallel interface for the
display doesn't make it fast enough to handle the bigger display, I
don't see much point in continuing this project. The larger display
with parallel interface was really the most important innovation
compared to my other projects.

I might resurrect it later on, if I find a way to speed things up, or
maybe use a different microcontroller again. For now, I'm putting it
on the back burner.
