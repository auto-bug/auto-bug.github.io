# It's Alive
Published on 2022-03-03 in {ref}`project-178061`.

I had some time to add the remaining resistors to the build, and to
compile a version of CircuitPython with my _stage module included. It
all went without too much problems.

I quickly copied the screen initialization for displayio from
Adafruit's ILI9341 driver, and copied all the other bits for the
ugame.py file from other platforms, and voila, we have a working game
console:

What's still left to do:


 1. tweak the display registers to get rid of flickering
 1. compile firmware with the display initialization included in C
 1. get the pwm audio to work
 1. think about a case, perhaps?

All in all, the large display is super-nice, and I'm also very happy
with the light but clicky buttons. The position of the S2 Mini module
is not great, but I can't think of any better way to place it.
