# Prototype 1
Published on 2022-02-24 in {ref}`project-178061`.

The PCBs arrived, and I assembled one. The screen is  a really nice
tight fit. The S2 Mini sticks out more than I would like — perhaps in
the final version I will solder it flat to the PCB, without the
headers. I still need to add all the resistors — figuring out their
values is more hassle than I am ready for right now. I used super-
light (7gf) clicky buttons this time, and I'm really happy with how
they feel.
