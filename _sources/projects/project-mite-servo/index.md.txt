I grew quite fond of the little 2g servos that I have used in
{ref}`project-188909` -- they are strong and fast enough for making things
move, and their compact size and small size of the plug makes them very easy to
hide inside devices. However, that plug also creates problems, because it's
difficult to use them without a dedicated PCB. I don't want to have to make a
special PCB for every project, so I want a servo shield, with a whole bunch of
servo connectors, and a chip that will take care of generating the PWM signals.
And of course I want this shield to be small, the same form factor as the Xiao
or Mite boards. That makes it impossible to use the good old PCA9685 LED driver
chip, so let's use a cheap CH32V003 chip with the right firmware.
