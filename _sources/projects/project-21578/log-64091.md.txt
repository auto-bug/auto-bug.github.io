# BOM Updated for PewPew Lite
Published on 2017-07-24 in {ref}`project-21578`.

Since I'm starting with PewPew Lite, I updated the bill of materials
to reflect that. the non-lite version will be done if the Lite version
catches on — otherwise I will switch to D1 Mini as the development
board.

I also added a link to the project's repository, and added a license
(it's CC by-nc-sa for now). The work on the tutorials is coming
slowly.
