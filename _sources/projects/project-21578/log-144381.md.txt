# Version 5.1
Published on 2018-04-18 in {ref}`project-21578`.

I have been doing some spring cleaning, and found the PCBs I made for
the version 5.1 of the PewPew, which I never actually assembled. That
version is bigger than my previous attempts, and uses a larger, 3cm
matrix. Since I will be soon going to work with that ISSI matrix
driver chip again (for the {ref}`project-100853` ), I decided to go ahead and assemble this after all. Here's the
result, next to the PewPew Lite for scale (please excuse the flux
stains):

Unfortunately, I didn't actually find the source of those bi-color
matrices with square pixels — the ones I have have round pixels, and
this one is desoldered from Adafruit's backpack, because it does look
much better. The new board does have sound, but lacks the battery
charging circuit — I assumed it will be powered by a non-
rechargeablecoin cell battery on the back. Unfortunately, I didn't
test it first, and turns out that the non-rechargeable batteries
simply don't have enough power for this to work.

I don't currently plan on making any more versions of this, or on
manufacturing this version — it's just something I wanted to finish. I
will probably be making more of the PewPew Lite FeatherWings for sale,
though, as there seems to be interest in those.
