# PewPew Lite Version 4.2
Published on 2018-05-08 in {ref}`project-21578`.

I had that version designed for quite a while, actually, and even the
PCBs arrived and were lying there in a drawer — but I didn't have time
to work on them, busy with other projects. Now I moved, and found the
PCBs in a box (and [@Benchoff ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/7) mentioned PewPew in an article), and decided to assemble them and put
up on sale on Tindie. So now there is a new version of the PewPew Lite
on Tinide. For now I only made ten, because that's how many boards I
had, but I already ordered some more, and more parts, so I will keep
them coming.

The new version comes with the matrix display already soldered, and
with staggered holes for the pin headers — so that you can simply
friction-fit them without soldering. The connection seems to be good
enough, but if you experience problems, you can always solder them.
There is still no socket for the battery — you will have to solder the
leads directly if you add it. There is simply no room for it on this
board.

Also, you no longer can choose a color. They are all red. It was the
preferred color anyways, yellow ones only got sold when the red ones
ran out.
