# Version 4.2
Published on 2017-10-24 in {ref}`project-21578`.

After finding the reason for CircuitPython crashes in #ÂµGame and
getting the audio amplifier to work, version 4.1 has pretty much all
the parts that I wanted to have. However, its physical layout is
somewhat problematic, especially the rather large speaker smack in the
middle of the board, which makes it hard to add a battery there.

So I started working on version 4.2. So far I have the following
changes:


 * Added guide holes for the USB socket.
 * Larger footprint for the flash chip, so that more chips can be used.
 * Smaller and cheaper reset switch.
 * Pads instead of holes for the battery connector.
 * Moved the audio amplifier circuit.
 * Moved the speaker to the front of the board, and used a footprint for
really small SMD speakers.
 * Moved some components away from each other, so it's not as cramped.

I'm still considering two more changes:


 * Add a voltage divider to an analog pin, for measuring battery voltage.
 * Move the charging circuit before the switch, so that charging is
possible with the switch off.

I think that 4.2 will be the last prototype, at least if everything
works as expected.
