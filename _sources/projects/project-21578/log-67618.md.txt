# PewPew 3.0 Standalone
Published on 2017-09-23 in {ref}`project-21578`.

After my last experiment with the homebrew Trinket M0, I designed and
ordered a board for PewPew that has its own Atmel SAMD21E chip on
board. It arrived today, and i assembled it and it seems to be
working! I was able to flash the UF2 bootloader and CircuitPython on
it, and to light up a couple of pixels on the display — I still need
to re-write the [pew.py](http://pew.py)  library for this platform. I'm especially worried about button
handling, since CircuitPython doesn't have any interrupt support. In
the worst case I might need to write the library in C and compile it
into my own fork of CircuitPython.

If it does come to that, I will probably also remap the pins, to use
ones not available on the Trinket, and to free up the DAC pin for
sound — adding a small amplifier and speaker would be great then. For
now the design is a little bit random, and I had to add one wire where
I missed a pull-up resistor. I expect to make more versions, and to
gradually clean up the design and arrange all the elements properly.

I'm also not happy with the location of the USB port, and generally
with how you touch the elements with your fingers while holding this.
I might actually get back to the "sandwich"  design with two PCBs, so
that the back of the bottom PCB could be completely clean of
components, and the battery could be hidden in between.
