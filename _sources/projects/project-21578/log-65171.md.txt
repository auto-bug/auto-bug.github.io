# Final version for the PewPew Lite
Published on 2017-08-15 in {ref}`project-21578`.

Yesterday I received the PCBs from [@oshpark ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216)  (Thank you so much for promoting them to super-swift service and fast
shipping!), and assembled them in the evening. They work perfectly,
and I'm really happy with this design. The power switch and the
connector for the battery are in the right place too.

I added a bunch of photos below in the "build instructions" section
from the assembly process. I haven't decided yet whether I want to
ship them completely soldered, or with the headers and the matrix
separately — they are a bit fiddly to do right, so it will be nice to
do them for the users, but then it makes it harder to ship them
cheaply, and the exact headers you want depends on what kind of
headers you have on your Feather board.

On the programming side, I updated the library to work with the new
version, optimizing the display routine a little bit in the process,
and also made the library disable the RGB status LED on those Feathers
that have it. Your programs can enable it back, of course, and provide
some ambient lighting.

I'm still thinking about the best way to write the tutorials for the
games. I have decided on the first game in the series — a simple maze
game. I also did some sketches for the accompanying illustrations.
This is the part that I will need to focus on for the rest of the time
left.
