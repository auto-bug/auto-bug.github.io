# Replaced by PewPew Standalone
Published on 2018-10-23 in {ref}`project-21578`.

While this still works and is fully compatible with all other PewPew
boards, and while I still sell it on Tindie, check out the new devices
over at {ref}`project-159733` â€” they are bigger and cheaper, though no color display.
