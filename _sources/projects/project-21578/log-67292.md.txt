# Tetris
Published on 2017-09-17 in {ref}`project-21578`.

This took me a little longer than I expected, but finally I wrote a
Tetris clone in just under 100 lines of code. The game is challenging
even at slow speed, because with the small screen you only have 6Ã—8
blocks to fill (2 columns are used for displaying the next brick).

Next up Boulderdash and Sokoban, and then maybe Arkanoid?
