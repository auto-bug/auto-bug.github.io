# Scrolling and Text
Published on 2017-07-23 in {ref}`project-21578`.

While most games will be simple enough to just use the individual
pixels on the matrix, we still need a way to display text to the
player — to show errors, to list the available games, to show the
"game over" text, etc. So today I worked on that.

I designed my own 4×6 4-color font specially for this. The effect of
using the 4 available colors for shading when they actually have very
different hues is a bit strange, but you get used to it and I think
it's actually quite readable:

I might add an option of displaying the text in just a single color —
the font is designed so that it's still readable if you "round" the
half tones.

The scrolling is actually quite slow on the SAMD feathers (the maximum
speed is about twice as on the gif above), but I think it's quite
sufficient for text.
