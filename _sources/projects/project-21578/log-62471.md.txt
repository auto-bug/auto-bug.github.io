# PewPew Lite
Published on 2017-07-03 in {ref}`project-21578`.

I decided to try and make a more minimalist version of this board,
replacing the IS31FL3733 LED matrix driver chip and the
microcontroller with a HT16K33 chip, which can do both LED matrix
control and key scanning at the same time. It will have no sound. Why
didn't I use HT16K33 in the first place? Well, the main reason is
because it can only switch the LEDs on or off, and doesn't have
brightness control for individual pixels. That means that there will
be only 4 colors available for each pixel: black, green, red and
yellow. On the other hand, this chip is cheaper, easier to source and
much easier to solder by hand.

The plan is to write the libraries in such a way, that most games will
work on both kinds of the boards -- as long as they don't require too
many subtle shades of colors. It should still be possible to make
Flappy Bird, Pong, Snake, Arkanoid, Space Invaders, Rogue, Boulder
Dash or similar clones, and even have some board games like Checkers
or Go. Chess would require much more colors, and it would be probably
hard to remember which shade is which piece.

As usual, I will see how it all works when the boards arrive.
