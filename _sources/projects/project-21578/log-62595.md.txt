# PewPew Lite Schematic
Published on 2017-07-05 in {ref}`project-21578`.

I decided to make a proper schematic for that PewPew Lite board I
ordered recently. You know, so that it's more complete and also so
it's easier to figure out what is what when I will be programming it.
Most PCB programs force you to start with the schematic, and only do
the PCB design later, but I'm using Fritzing specifically because it
lets me do it in any order â€“ and I get much better PCB layout this
way, because many times it doesn't really matter which pin I use for a
particular function, so I can as well just pick the one that is
easiest to route.

Once I did that, I brought up the datasheet for the HT16K33 chip to
see whether I will need a common cathode or a common anode LED matrix,
and I noticed a grave error: the buttons are connected to the address
select pin (COM0) and not to the buttons pins (COM1-COM3). Oops. (The
schematic above has that already fixed.)

Of course I quickly corrected that. Fortunately, the two pins are
close together and close the the diode, so it should be relatively
easy to cut the trace and connect it to the other pin with a piece of
wire. Still very embarrassing. I guess next time I should make the
schematic before ordering the PCB.
