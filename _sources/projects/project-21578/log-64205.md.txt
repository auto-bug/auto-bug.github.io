Published on 2017-07-25 in {ref}`project-21578`.

A gathered all my attempts at a microcontroller-based simple game
console, and took a photo:

On the far right you can see {ref}`project-7011` , then there is a bunch of different versions of the {ref}`project-21578` , in the far left corner there is {ref}`project-19371` , and below it there are two other shields for D1 Mini with buttons.
The D1 Mini shields are too small to hold comfortably, and the small
joystick is pretty hard to use, at least without anything on top of
it. The feather boards are just the right size, provided the whole
assembly is not too thick, like the one in the center with a battery
shield.Â
