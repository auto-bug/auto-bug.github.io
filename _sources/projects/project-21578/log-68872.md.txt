# PyWeek, Here I Come
Published on 2017-10-15 in {ref}`project-21578`.

There is this challenge, where you have to write a game in Python in
one week. I never really had the time for it (I preferred Ludum Dare,
where you only have one weekend, so it's easier), but I decided to try
and enter this time. Of course CircuitPython is Python too, so I'm
going to develop a new game for PewPew. But since others wouldn't be
able to play it without making their own PewPew, I will also write an
emulator for it.

Here's my entry:Â  [https://pyweek.org/e/pewpew/](https://pyweek.org/e/pewpew/) 

The topic is "They're behind everything". Wish me luck.
