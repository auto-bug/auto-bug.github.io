The PCBs arrived, and I assemble the first four kits already:

A single kit is 4 pieces: the PCB with all the SMD parts soldered, the
two pin headers, and the LED matrix. You will have to solder them all

This is for two reasons. FIrst, it's much easier to ship it without
the headers on, second, I don't know what headers you have on your
Feather, and you need matching ones.
