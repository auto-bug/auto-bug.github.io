# Version 1.5
Published on 2017-06-18 in {ref}`project-21578`.

The boards for version 1.5 arrived yesterday, and today I had some
time to assemble one. It didn't work initially, but after touching
each solder joint with the soldering iron again, it started to work.
Go figure.

Programming of the ATmega8 went smoothly, and it does appear as an IÂ²C
device together with the display controller, so everything seems fine.
I will test the key scanning and the display library later. The sound
code requires some more work before it's usable -- hopefully I will be
able to beat it into shape soon.

:::
I already have a version 1.6 PCB designed -- the only difference is
that it has pads for an SMD speaker, and that the speaker is driven
from two GPIO pins, not one and ground -- giving me one more bit of
resolution and louder volume. I'm not ordering that yet, though,
because I'm sure I will have some ideas for improvements while working
with the version 1.5.\
