# Documentation
Published on 2017-08-30 in {ref}`project-21578`.

The beginnings of the documentation, so far only the library
reference, are now uploaded to [http://pewpew.readthedocs.io](http://pewpew.readthedocs.io)  for convenience. More work on the documentation is ongoing, including
graphics:

We also had a sprint at [PyCon.PL](http://pl.pycon.org)  two weeks ago â€” I just didn't have time to write about it. Some
awesome programmers tried their skills, and wrote a classic Snake
game, and a Conway's Game of Life implementation. I noticed some
problems with the documentation along the way, and fixed them.

Right now I'm working on the game tutorials themselves, starting with
a simple maze game.
