# Version 1.4
Published on 2017-05-13 in {ref}`project-21578`.

I ordered the PCB for version 1.4 from OSHPark on May 1st. It was sent
to fab the same day, and shipped on May 4th. Today (May 13th) I found
it in my mailbox. I was waiting for it eagerly, hoping it would arrive
before May 17th, when I'm departing for [PyCon.us](http://PyCon.us)  -- I wanted to take the prototype with me to show it there. It
actually arrived 4 days earlier than anticipated, which is great!

However, I'm still missing parts for it. The buttons I was able to
scavenge from the earlier prototypes, but this new version uses a
TM1650 chip for handling the buttons, and that is still on its way
from China (it took the seller two weeks to ship it). You can see the
empty footprint waiting for it.

Then again, I was able to verify that the display works (I was a bit
afraid I broke something when moving the chip on the other side of the
board).

Hopefully the chips arrive soon, or I will also receive the version
1.2 of the prototype -- that's the one with the buttons connected
directly to GPIO pins, and with ghosting problems. That was also
ordered on May 1st, but shipped on May 9th, so 5 days later...
