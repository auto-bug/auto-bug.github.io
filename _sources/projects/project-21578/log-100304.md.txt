# LAMEBOY Playing PewPew Games
Published on 2018-02-23 in {ref}`project-21578`.

I recently assembled a [@davedarko](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459) 's {ref}`project-26823`  kit, and I wrote a simple library in MicroPython to handle all the
hardware on the device. Then I thought, hey, this has buttons and
display, I bet it could run PewPew games! So I ported the library to
CircuitPython and added a small compatibility library for PewPew, and
lo and behold, the games work!

And since the ESP8266 has much more memory than the poort little
SAMD21, you don't even have to precompile the libraries. It all fits
with room to spare.
