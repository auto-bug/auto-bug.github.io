# Displays Are Hard
Published on 2017-08-10 in {ref}`project-21578`.

Yesterday the breakout board I made for those tiny displays arrived,
so today I soldered one and tried to get it to work. So far
unsuccessfully, but we will see what the future brings.

The datasheet at the seller's Aliexpress page only has this image as
the information:

And then this table:

The product page has ST7735S in the title, so I'm working under the
assumption that it is indeed a ST7735-series chip. Assuming that, and
looking at the datasheet, I'm guessing the following pins:

<table ><thead ><tr ><th >Image</th><th >Datasheet</th></tr></thead><tbody ><tr ><td >GND</td><td >GND</td></tr><tr ><td >IOVCC (1.8/2.8V)</td><td >VDDI\
</td></tr><tr ><td >SPI</td><td >SPI4W</td></tr><tr ><td >IM2</td><td >IM2</td></tr><tr ><td >CS</td><td >CSX</td></tr><tr ><td >RESET</td><td >RESX</td></tr><tr ><td >RS/SCL</td><td >D/CX (SCL)</td></tr><tr ><td >WR/A0</td><td >WRX (D/CX)</td></tr><tr ><td >E/RD</td><td >RDX</td></tr><tr ><td >D0/SDA</td><td >D0 (SDA)</td></tr><tr ><td >D1-7</td><td >D1-7</td></tr><tr ><td >VDD-2.8V</td><td >VDD</td></tr><tr ><td >LEDA</td><td >Backlight LED Anode</td></tr><tr ><td >LEDK</td><td >Backlight LED Cathode</td></tr></tbody></table>The first test was connecting power to the LED anode and cathode pins,
and sure enough, I got the backlight going. Yay, that means I know the
direction in which the pins are numbered.

Then I tried wiring it for the 4-wire SPI mode, since that's what I
already have the drivers for. I connected VDD, VDDI, LEDA, and SPI to
power, GND, LEDK and IM2 to ground, and all the SPI pins, and tried
the driver. Nothing, white screen. Tried a second display just to be
sure. Same. Hmmm...

(By the way, when you are making a breakout like this, and make it
exactly the size of the display, like I did, then make sure that: 1.
the pins are a multiple of 2.54mm apart, so that you can insert it
into the breadboard, and 2. you put the pin markings on the side that
is not covered by the display.)
