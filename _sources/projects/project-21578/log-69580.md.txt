# PyWeek Failure
Published on 2017-10-22 in {ref}`project-21578`.

The week has ended and the contest is now closed. I didn't manage to
finish my game, even though I was very careful to set the scope small.
There were simply too many distractions during the week.

I still plan to finish that game one day, it's a top-down shooter
similar to the Alien Breed series or the classic "Into the Eagle's
Nest". I feel it can be really fun to play on PewPew.
