# PewPew Lite Assembled
Published on 2017-07-17 in {ref}`project-21578`.

The PCBs for the PewPew Lite arrived from [@oshpark](https://hackaday.iohttps://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) , so I assembled one and I'm really happy with it:

I didn't have an SMD diode at hand, so I just put a THT one there, and
connected it to the correct pin (there was a mistake in the PCB, if
you remember the previous log). I also quickly extended my HT16K33
drivers with a class for this board:


```python
class PewPewLite(Matrix8x8x2):
    def _copy_buf(self):
        pixel = self.framebuffer.pixel
        _buffer = self._buffer
        for y in range(8):
            b = 0
            for x in range(8):
                color = pixel(y, x)
                if color & 0x01:
                    b |= 0x01 << x
                if color & 0x02:
                    b |= 0x01 << (15 - x)
            _buffer[14 - y * 2] = b & 0xff
            _buffer[15 - y * 2] = (b >> 8) & 0xff

    def keys(self):
        return int.from_bytes(self.i2c.readfrom_mem(self.address, 0x40, 2),
                              'little') >> 5
```

Nothing too fancy, just had to adjust the rotation and add a method
for reading the keys.

I also received the PCB for {ref}`project-25256`  with the THT buttons, and now I'm thinking about how to use those
buttons also with this project, as they are much more compact.
Probably won't work, since I really need stuff on both sides of the
PCB. There is one more type of buttons that I might try -- they are
SMD, but use pads under the buttons, and not legs, like the ones here.

And of course I *really* need to start writing the games for this. I
already have ideas of a dozen of them.
