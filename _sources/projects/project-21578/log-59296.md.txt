# Prototyping
Published on 2017-05-10 in {ref}`project-21578`.

While I'm waiting for the new PCBs with two different approaches to
buttons, I decided to start writing some code. But I need to test it
somehow, and it's difficult with the non-functional buttons, so I
decided to use a combo of the {ref}`project-19371`  and {ref}`project-18120` . Sure, the x-pad shield uses a different chip than what I will use,
and the matrix shield only has 1 shade of 1 color, but at least I can
get some code going on them. I can later replace the parts that handle
the display and keys.
