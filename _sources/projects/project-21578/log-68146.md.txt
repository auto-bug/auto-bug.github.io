# Replicating the Trinket M0 Express Hack
Published on 2017-10-02 in {ref}`project-21578`.

It would be great to have more memory on PewPew, so I decided to try
and replicate the  [Trinket M0 Express](https://daveastels.com/2017/09/01/trinket-m0-express-hack/)  hack, only with my bare chip. To do that, I need a flash chip. The
original hack used a _S25FL116K0XMFI043_ chip, but of course I don't have that. But they should all be pretty
much the same, no? So I tried with a _W25Q32FVSSIG_ instead:

The connections are pretty much what you would expect:

And the board definition is in this branch:  [https://github.com/pewpew-game/circuitpython/tree/trinket-m0-express](https://github.com/pewpew-game/circuitpython/tree/trinket-m0-express) 

After compiling and flashing the firmware, it... doesn't work. I mean,
the CircuitPython itself works and shows me the REPL console, but
there is no USB disk. And it's easy to see why — there is a number of
files in the_boards _directory that contain flash chip definitions, and that you include in
your board definition files. And guess what, the chip I'm using is not
there. So I have two options now: dive into the datasheets and prepare
my own flash definition file, which would be the "correct" choice, or
order a flash chip that is compatible with what is there already, then
wait a few weeks for it to arrive and try again, which is the "lazy"
choice. Guess which one I've chosen.

Since I'm waiting for the PCBs and parts for the next version of
PewPew anyways...

Update: So I overcame by inherent laziness and created a flash file
for the W25Q32BV family. And what do you know, it works!
