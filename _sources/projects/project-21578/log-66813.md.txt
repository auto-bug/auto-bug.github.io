# The Store is Live
Published on 2017-09-07 in {ref}`project-21578`.

You can order the PewPew Lite boards from the Tindie store now!

The link is here: [https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/pewpew-lite-featherwing/](https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/pewpew-lite-featherwing/) 

So far there is only one game for it, Snake (not the same that was
written the last PyCon PLÂ sprint, this is a much simpler code), and
I'm still writing the tutorials, but the first four boards are there.
