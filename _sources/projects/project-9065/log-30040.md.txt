# Fixed Board
Published on 2016-01-07 in {ref}`project-9065`.

After some cosmetic touches, I'm finally happy enough with the first
version of the PCB for this robot. It looks something like this:

 [The Fritzing file is in the repository](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote0/src/tip/tote0.fzz) , and the [Gerber is available for download.](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote0/downloads/tote0.zip)  I used a new approach for the servo sockets -- since the Pi Zero is
going to be plugged as a second layer, we don't really have enough
space for the usual servo sockets. So I used one long header with
angled pins -- the servos plug in two rows into that, fitting between
the Pi and the board.

Other than that, the board has the serial and IÂ²C pins broken out, and
also a header for all the pins that are not used for controlling
servos. There is also a jumper in there, for disconnecting the servo
power from the Pi -- so that we can power the two from two different
sources if we need to.

The usual holes, as in Tote, are for attaching the servo horns for the
legs.
