# Robot Fusion
Published on 2016-11-06 in {ref}`project-9065`.

So I never actually made that board from the last log. But remember {ref}`project-9927` , those robots that we have built at Hackaday Belgrade? I have spent a
considerable amount of time designing that PCB, and it has a couple of
Easter eggs in there. On of them is that unpopulated pin header in the
lower right corner:

Turns out that you can put a female pin header in there:

And then, instead of plugging that ESP8266 module in the usual socket,
you can plug a Raspberry Pi Zero in there:

The power from the LiPo is only between 3.7 and 4.2V, but turns out
that this is enough for the pi -- its regulator will switch into a
low-voltage mode, and everything works:

Next, I will just need to take the MicroPython code I used on the
original, and touch it up to run on regular Python on the pi, with the
SMBus library for the IÂ²C communication.
