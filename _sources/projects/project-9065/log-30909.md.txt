# First Walk
Published on 2016-01-27 in {ref}`project-9065`.

So today I figured out which servo is on which leg, rebuilt the legs
to make the coxas longer, trimmed all servos again, added pieces of
rubber tube as feet, and replaced the battery with a larger one.

I also adjusted the voltage to be exactly 5V (it was 5.2V for some
reason), hopefully that will make this thing heat less.

Finally, I made some small fixes and adjustment to the code, and lo
and behold, we have a walking robot!

It's still not perfect, of course, but at last it works.
