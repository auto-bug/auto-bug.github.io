# Everything in One?
Published on 2016-02-11 in {ref}`project-9065`.

o I haven't done much work on this during the week, but I did do some
thinking, and the results of that are pretty scary. First, I realized
that using Servo Blaster and all those pins is not really that
convenient, when I can simply have a {ref}`project-9131`  from a Pro Mini. Second, while Pi Zero is cheap, a WiFi dongle and SD
Card for them are not. ESP8266 is cheap, though, and you can do {ref}`project-8678`  with it. Can't really do much about the SD Card, apart from using a
cheap, small one.

Anyways, putting it all together, I got something like this:

It has room for ESP8266, Pro Mini and Pi Zero, 12 servo sockets, IR
sensor socket, and a voltage regulator module. I had to use both sides
of the PCB with surface pads, and the RPi header doesn't quite fit on
the 5cm board, but that's details.

How would you use this? There are three options. Only put a Pro Mini
there, and you have the simple version of {ref}`project-6050`  with remote control. Add a ESP8266 with the right firmware, talking
to the Pro Mini over IÂ²C, and you have a Micropython or Lua-based
robot with WiFi. Finally, add a voltage regulator and Pi Zero, and you
have a perambulating computer, with WiFi over ESP8266 and possibly a
USB camera.

Will this work? I honestly have no idea. I cobbled this PCB together
over several evenings, stealing ideas that I don't fully understand
all over Hackaday. It does, however, sound like the right way forward.
