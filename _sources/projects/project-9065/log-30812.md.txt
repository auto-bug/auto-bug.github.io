# Single-port USB Hub
Published on 2016-01-25 in {ref}`project-9065`.

In order to make working on the robot a little bit easier, I added a
small USB hub that I had lying around, with a cheap WiFi card soldered
to it. This way I have access to the board and still can use a single
USB port for, say, a webcam.

Otherwise the progress has been slow. I adjusted and trimmed the
servos, so that the robot can stand in the "zero" position, but I
still haven't tested the inverse kinematics or walking code.
