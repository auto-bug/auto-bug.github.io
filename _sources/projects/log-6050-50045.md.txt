# Version 5
Published on 2016-12-07 in {ref}:project-6050:.

I've been asked for a Tote kit for a Christmas preset by a friend, and
I realized I no longer have any version 4 boards. So I had to go and
order some. But if I'm ordering boards anyways, why not make some
improvements here and there? So here's a version 5.

You can see the board is much simpler now. It's basically just the
servos, the battery, the pro mini, power switch and ir sensor. There
are still the optional battery monitoring, piezo, distance sensor and
extra capacitor, but by default they are not used. I also switched
some pins around, so now using the serial pins for servos -- but all
the analog pins are free, and broken out close to each of the legs.
That should make it easier to use them for sensors.

There is also a new step-by-step assembly tutorial for this version at [http://tote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly_v5.html](http://tote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly_v5.html)  and slightly modified code at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/src/tip/v5](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/src/tip/v5) .
