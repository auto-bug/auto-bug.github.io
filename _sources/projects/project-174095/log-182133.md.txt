# Design Files and Schematic
Published on 2020-08-12 in {ref}`project-174095`.

I have now fixed the two problems I found with the PCB, and uploaded
the Gerbers and the Fritzing files. The keyboard uses the same
bootloader and CircuitPython firmware as the {ref}`project-171381` — that's the convenience of having a board that breaks out all the
pins.

I'm still working on the Python code for the mod keys, of course — I
will post it separately when it's ready.

Here's the schematic of the keyboard:
