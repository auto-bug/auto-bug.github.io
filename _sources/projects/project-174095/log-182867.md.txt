They switches and keycaps arrived while I was on vacation, but now I'm
back and I assembled it all.

All switches nicely soldered, and straight:

Then I just inserted all the keycaps. Of course I had to be a little
creative about the bottom row and the enter key, since those keys
mostly didn't come in 1u versions.

You would think that after adding the switches the code that I
previously wrote would just work. Well, that would surely be
something, but no — there were some inevitable minor bugs. Then, after
fixing them I tried it for a bit, and decided to rearrange the keys a
little bit to expose the more commonly used symbols better.

I'm still having a couple of problems. The Shift key is too low, and
the backspace takes some getting used to. I also discovered why
hold/tap is usually done with a timeout and not like I did it — I
can't use the modifier keys with mouse clicks as it is now. I will add
a long timeout for that.
