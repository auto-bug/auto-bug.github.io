# DotStars
Published on 2020-10-02 in {ref}`project-174095`.

Finally tonight I took a look at the lights on this keyboard. The
Adafruit's DotStar library handles them very well, but for some reason
the last 6 in a chain had different colors. After some experiments, I
desoldered the switches, removed that LED, put a different one in its
place and the problem magically disappeared.

I also wrote some very simple code to make a pretty gradient. Static
for now. I'm going to call it a day, but tomorrow I will probably try
to make some nice effects, like a water ripple on each keystroke, or
something like that.

Oh, right, because both {ref}`project-167912` and {ref}`project-174982` are now dead and buried, I took the black double-shot key caps from
them. I think they look quite pretty with the backlight.
