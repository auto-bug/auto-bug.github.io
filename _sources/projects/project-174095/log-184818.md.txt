# Macros
Published on 2020-10-09 in {ref}`project-174095`.

Over the last weekend I worked a little bit more on the code, cleaning
it up and making it a library. I also added the ability of sending
keys with modifiers, and media keys. And that means I have everything
I need to turn this keyboard into a macro keyboard.

I programmed the bottom row to be numbers (for quickly switching
things in games), then there are the function keys, the media keys
(volume up/down, play/pause, next, prev, etc.), some of the rarely
used keys (PrintScr, Pause and ScrollLock) and the top row switches my
workspaces.
