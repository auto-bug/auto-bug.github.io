# Hacking on Tote
Published on 2015-05-31.

Since Tote evolved from [µKubik](https://hackaday.io/project/3300-kubik-quadruped-robot) , I put all updates about it there. But now that it is pretty much
ready, I'm going to do some experimenting and extending and hacking on
it, and I think it makes sense to have a separate project page for
that, and leave the Python-powered µKubik alone.
