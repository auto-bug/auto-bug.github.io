# Another Tote in the Wild
Published on 2016-01-23 in :ref:project-6050.

Today I spent most of the day with a friend building his own instance
of Tote. Not only it was great fun, but I also learned a bit about
which parts need work (unsurprisingly, tuning and trimming the servos
is hard). We also experimented with a slightly different leg geometry
(the hip servos rotated by 90Â°), which gives slightly longer legs with
better reach. I think I will make it the default.

One particularly hairy problem we've hit is that his 3.3V Pro Mini is
apparently set to 16Mhz for some reason. Fortunately I have programmed
Arduinos with the wrong frequency before and recognized the symptoms
(the servos got wrong frequency signal), and the board still works
with 3.3V (for this AVR this counts as overclocking), but I wonder if
it wouldn't cause some problems with more sensitive parts, such as the
EEPROM.
