# Hardware Version 4 and Sound
Published on 2017-11-09 in {ref}`project-27629`.

The PCBs arrived from [@oshpark ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) today (I can't thank them enough for all the help I'm getting from
them, including the coupons and fast shipping), so time to assemble
the next hardware version. This time there were no surprises, the
board seems to work.

This new version has the buttons spaced a bit farther apart from each
other, which makes assembly much easier. It also has an audio
amplifier and a tiny speaker. Since I'm still waiting for the 4x4mm
speakers to arrive, I used a bigger SMD speaker for now for tests, and
it's pretty loud! The small speaker will probably be much quieter, but
I think it will still be good enough.

I still need to connect the battery and test the charging circuit, but
I don't expect much trouble there — the first version has that working
well.
