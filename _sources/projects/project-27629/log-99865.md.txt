# The First Case
Published on 2018-02-22 in {ref}`project-27629`.

While several people are working on 3D-printed cases for the µGame, [@davedarko ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459) is the first to deliver! He designed [a minimalist case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2797538)  that covers the battery on the back, but leaves the PCB exposed for
perusal. Since his µGame already had a battery attached, he [sent the design](https://twitter.com/SzymonJakubiak/status/965001051580588037)  to Szymon Jakubiak for printing and testing. When all was confirmed
working, he printed two of them in colors matching the prototypes, and
sent them to me:

They look pretty slick, if I can say so myself!
