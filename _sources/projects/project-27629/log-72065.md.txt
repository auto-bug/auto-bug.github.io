# nGame is µGame, only Smaller
Published on 2017-12-28 in {ref}`project-27629`.

While I was designing the {ref}`project-19371` , the {ref}`project-21578` and most recently µGame, I struggled with the same problem: how to fit
the direction pads and fire buttons on as small PCB area as possible,
while still keeping them usable. I think I have tested pretty much any
type of SMD buttons on offer from China, tried different layouts and
packing schemes, and even did some uncanny experiments with fitting
larger buttons to smaller footprints. But I never quite had the
courage to really push the limits. Until now, that is.

This is what happens to µGame when you leave it in your pants pocket
in the dryer and let it shrink. It uses the same ST7725S display that
I used in {ref}`project-27033` — even the driver fits, you just have to adjust the screen size in it.
It uses the smallest 2-pad buttons I could find — they use 1206
resistor footprints. The SAMD21 microcontroller has no additional
flash storage this time, so we are very constrained in what fits there
— none of the demos for µGame I had worked out of the box, that's why
the photo shows just random pixels.

On the back you can see the 2032 coin cell battery, the power switch
and the voltage regulator circuit, the USB socket and the shottky
diode that isolates the battery from the USB power. There is no
battery charging, no audio output, no battery monitoring and even no
reset button (you can reset it to get to the bootloader by shorting
one of the vias to ground). I still have some free space in that
corner (and it's also free on the other side), so I might add a hole
for a keychain there...

As I said, the memory constraints are severe, and I haven't written a
game or demo that actually runs on it, but I'm sure I can do it. In
the worst case, I can drop the wasteful CircuitPython and program this
thing with Arduino.

This whole thing is basically just to see how hard it would be to
build (moderately), and use (hard, you have to press the buttons with
your fingernails). Also, because I kinda felt bad switching the final
µGame version to use old Nokia phone batteries after submitting this
to the coin cell contest. So here, a version that still runs on the
coin cell.

Also big thanks to the hackers on the {ref}`project-5373` for helping me debug the power/USB problems.
