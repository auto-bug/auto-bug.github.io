# µGame Turbo
Published on 2018-04-02 in {ref}`project-27629`.

I didn't mention this yet here, but I have started work on an improved
(and more expensive) version of this device. I the good old style of
80s, I decided to call it {ref}`project-86818` (if there is going to be a third version, it will be Super µGame
Turbo, of course). I'm still researching most things, but the goal is
to mostly have a physically bigger screen (same resolution), more
memory and better audio (better speaker, volume control, headphone
jack). It should be software-compatible with the current µGame,
though.

I am not sure how that project will go, and whether I will be selling
that new version of the device too — there are currently simply too
many variables.
