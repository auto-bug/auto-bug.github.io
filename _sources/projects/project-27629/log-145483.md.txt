# In Stock Again
Published on 2018-04-30 in {ref}`project-27629`.

The freshly assembled µGames arrived straight from [@Makerfabs ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/245194) and you can again get them from Tindie — there is a link at the top of
this page. I will also take a few to {ref}`project-34330` — you can let me know in advance if you want to save on the shipping
costs. I am not sure yet what other meetups I will attend (Makerfaire
Prague is a possibility, and Europython is pretty much settled).
