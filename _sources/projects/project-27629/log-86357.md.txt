# We Have Stock!
Published on 2018-01-31 in {ref}`project-27629`.

Today the package from China arrived: 50 shiny new devices. There was
a small number of faulty ones that failed testing — it turned out to
be a bad speaker, which fortunately was easily replaced. One board
didn't flash at all — that turned out to be a faulty reset button.
This one I didn't fix, but instead I will be using it as the demo unit
(because during troubleshooting I had to de-solder some parts, and it
doesn't look brand-new anymore).

In any case, if you are interested, the Tindie link is here:  [https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/game-10-game-console-kit/](https://www.tindie.com/products/deshipu/game-10-game-console-kit/) 

I would also greatly appreciate if you could spread the word!
