# The Power of Plain C
Published on 2017-10-29 in {ref}`project-27629`.

I was expecting a considerable speedup from rewriting the whole
rendering code as a C module and compiling it into the CircuitPython
firmware, but a 50x improvement is much better than anticipated. I was
afraid that I will have to limit myself to just a few sprites on the
screen at once, and just one or two layers of tiles. But with this
speed, there is no such problem. Of course, it will still slow down to
around one frame per second if I fill the whole screen with animated
sprites, but I think even Â¼ of screen is already workable.
