# Built-in Sprites
Published on 2017-11-06 in {ref}`project-27629`.

The RAM memory is quite limited on the SAMD21, which means that you
can only load about 4 or 5 banks of graphics at once. But there is
some free flash memory in the custom CircuitPython firmware, so we can
put some stock graphics in there. So I've been working a little on
drawing the character sprites for that:

The colors are all funny, because I tried to make them distinct, so
that you can easily re-color the sprites by custom palettes (a palette
is only 32 bytes, while a bank is 2048). I'm trying to standardize the
color positions in the palette too, so that you can use the same
palettes for recoloring multiple banks.

The characters are mostly inspired by the GameBoy, SNES and NES
classics, though they are not exact copies of any game in particular.
They should retain the general feel, though.
