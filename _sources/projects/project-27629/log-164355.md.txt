# The Last µGame
Published on 2019-06-06 in {ref}`project-27629`.

Yesterday I received the order for the last µGame on Tindie. That
makes it 111 units sold on Tindie (and maybe a dozen more sold
elsewhere). Since I don't plan on making any more of them, that was
the last µGame being sold.

The project is not finished, of course — I will continue to improve
the firmware, and I want to write a few more games for it. I won't be
making promises, though — reality has a way of getting into my plans.

If you want to try developing such games with CircuitPython yourself,
you can now get the PyBadge board from Adafruit — apart from a
slightly bigger screen and much more powerful MCU, it's compatible, so
all the games should work on it.

I have certainly learned a lot with this project, and I hope there
will still grow a community of users for it.
