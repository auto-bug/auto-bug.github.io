# Extra Characters
Published on 2017-11-05 in {ref}`project-27629`.

Initially, my font file contained only 96 characters, ignoring the
"control characters" that appear in the first 32 entries of the ASCII
table. I realized that this is a waste, and decided to extend my font
file to cover all 128 characters, and put some special things in the
first 32 glyphs. Here's what I came up with:

The first four are arrows — always useful. Then there are icons for
the two fire buttons this console has — useful when asking the player
to press them. Then there is a number of random stuff that you might
want to display on a status bar or in the inventory. Finally, some
extra punctuation.

I'm not sure how useful this will turn out to be and if I wouldn't be
much better off if I used that space for accented characters from a
few European languages — but I can never cover all the languages
anyways. In the worst case I can change it, and the users can always
provide their own custom fonts too — there is a script in the
repository for generating the script data from a BMP file.
