# Audio Woes
Published on 2017-12-03 in {ref}`project-27629`.

If you watched my previous video, you surely noticed that the sound is
very bad. That's not the recording, the sound *is* very bad. I get a
lot of clicking, buzzing and droning, even if nothing is playing. I
think the clicking may be coming from the wav files not
beginning/ending on a 0, and at least part of the buzzing is from my
fingers touching the audio in track on the back of the PCB, but there
is definitely something more going on.

Needless to say, I would love to get that fixed, so that is the next
task. It will possibly involve redesigning the whole audio circuit.
Helpful advice welcome.
