# nGame Revisited
Published on 2018-02-05 in {ref}`project-27629`.

nGame (nano-game) is the tiny little brother of µGame that I made just
to see if I can do it. It's a little bit bigger than an inch on a
side. I got the hardware working, but I didn't have any program to
test it with, since all the games I've written so far were too big to
fit on the chip's flash (unlike µGame, nGame doesn't have a separate
flash chip for the filesystem). When I was picking the projects to
send to FOSDEM to be shown at the MicroPython table, I thought I could
include nGame, and I realized that the bouncing ball demo that I added
recently should fit just fine. So I quickly uploaded that, and it
worked out of the box, except for the wrong colors (RGB vs. BGR) and
different screen size (160×80 instead of 128×128). But I didn't have
time to fix it, so I sent it like that.

Today evening I finally had some time to sit down and do it properly —
I just needed to fix the display driver, and fix the code where I
hard-coded the screen size.
