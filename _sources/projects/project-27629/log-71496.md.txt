# Version 6
Published on 2017-12-13 in {ref}`project-27629`.

The PCBs for version 6 arrived about a week ago, but I didn't have
time to work on it, between the day job and being sick. This evening I
finally tested it properly:

The good things:


 * moving the audio circuit was a good move, it's now completely out of
reach of fingers, and I think it also seems a bit louder when the LOS
is not obscured by hands,
 * using straight switch instead of angled one for reset also works well
— I can have a hole in the case (if I have a case) for pressing it
with a pin,
 * straight buttons are easier to solder,
 * adding a CS pin made the displays all work consistently,
 * moving the LDO away from the buttons also made it easier to solder.

There are still some rough edges, though, that I only found out after
actually testing a physical prototype.

The bad things:


 * the CS pin uses a via, and touching that via with your fingers makes
the display stop updating — I need to route that trace on front side
entirely,
 * the charging LED still shines whenever USB is connected, even if the
battery is disconnected  — it does go off when the battery is fully
charged, though,

So I scrapped the version 7 which was basically just a cleanup of
version 6 ready for ordering a larger number of them, and prepared
version 8. I moved practically all parts around, including the
microcontroller and the flash chip, but now:


 * the reset button is next to the direction buttons, not on the edge of
the pcb,
 * all components, except for the audio circuit, are together in the
middle of the board,
 * the signals for audio and for the display are routed on one side
without any vias,
 * there are no parts under the fingers anymore,
 * the top fire button got moved to the edge to make room for the parts,
so now the layout looks more like gameboy,
 * all the parts are better spaced and have shorter traces between them,
 * there are more mounting holes (some are under the display, but with
flat heads that could still be useful),
 * I have broken out four unused pins on the back, for possible hacking,
 * I moved the battery connector to the other side of the board, so it
now matches the layout of Nokia phone (dumb) batteries.

I know I said that about the previous version, but this is really to
be the last one I'm making (at least with this microcontroller and
display) — if everything works, that is. I'm going to order this one
at Aisler again, to see how they improved (and to get a stencil).
