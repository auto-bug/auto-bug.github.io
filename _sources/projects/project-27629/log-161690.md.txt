# CircuitPython 4.0 and Display Support
Published on 2019-04-12 in {ref}`project-27629`.

The upcoming CircuitPython 4.0 introduces, among other things, built-
in support for displays. That means that when there is an error in
your code, you will be able to see it right there on the screen,
without having to connect to some gnarly serial ports. For now the
built-in display code is slow — fast enough for displaying text, but
not for games. So I went and modified my {ref}`project-80626`  library to coexist with the displayio support, to get the best of
both world — console using displayio, and fast updates using stage.

There are still some tweaks left to do, perhaps use of a smaller font,
and I still need to resolve the audioio problems that appeared with
CircuitPython 3.0, but there are already nice improvements.

I also hope to see if I can use DMA to speed up display updates
considerably.
