# Sound Issues Resolved
Published on 2017-12-05 in {ref}`project-27629`.

As usual, the problem was in software. Actually, not even that, it was
in the data. Turns out the .wav files I used were at fault â€” they
didn't start at a zero value (hence the clicks at the beginning) and
they were truncated compared to what was specified in their headers
(hence the buzzing at the end). Running the files through sox fixed
both problems and gave me nice retro sound:

Yes, there is a bug with the missile not getting deleted halfway
through the game.
