# Battery Life
Published on 2017-12-02 in {ref}`project-27629`.

Since I entered this into the #Coin Cell Challenge, I'd better write
something about the battery power. All the prototypes so far have on
their back a socket for a LIR2302 battery, and a built-in charging
circuit. The later prototypes also have connectors for other
batteries.

The 40mAh LIR2302 lets you play for about... 40 minutes. I didn't add
any sound to any of my games yet (thought I did test that it works
well with wav files) — I expect that using sounds will shorten the
play time somewhat.\


The charging circuit has been limited to around 40mA, so that it won't
damage the tiny batteries.

It is possible to use a different LiPo battery than the coin cells.
For example, a battery from a small cellphone (not smartphone) works
well, especially since it's about the same size as the device and
nicely fits flat on the back. In such case it's recommended to replace
the current-setting resistor in the battery charging circuit to a 10kΩ
(for 100mAh battery) or even 5kΩ (for 200mAh battery or larger), for
faster charging.
