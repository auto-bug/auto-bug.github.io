# Version 3
Published on 2017-10-22 in {ref}`project-27629`.

After writing down all the changes I wanted, I started to play with
the PCB to see if they were possible, and of course I made another
version with all the changes I wanted:

I managed to keep the back clear of parts, save for the battery and
speaker, which really can't fit anywhere else. I also modified the
battery charging circuit a little, to make it possible to charge the
battery with the unit powered off. Hopefully it won't drain the
battery.

I'm going to sit on this a little bit and if I don't have any more
ideas, I will order it tomorrow.
