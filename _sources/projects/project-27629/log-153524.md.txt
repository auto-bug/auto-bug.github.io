# Updated Firmware with CircuitPython 3.2.0
Published on 2018-09-30 in {ref}`project-27629`.

CircuitPython 3.2.0 has been released a while ago, and brings a lot of
bug fixes and some performance improvements. It would be nice to use
it for ÂµGame. Unfortunately, it also had some changes in how audio is
handled, and since that interacted with available memory in ways that
made the example games not work, it required more work on my part than
just rebasing the repository.

However, I managed to work around the problems, and a new version of
the firmware is now available at [https://github.com/python-
ugame/circuitpython/releases/tag/ugame10-3.2.0](https://github.com/python-ugame/circuitpython/releases/tag/ugame10-3.2.0) . There is also a release of the Vacuum Invaders game specially
updated for that version of firmware: [https://github.com/python-ugame/vacuum-invaders/releases/tag/3.2.0](https://github.com/python-ugame/vacuum-invaders/releases/tag/3.2.0) . The other example games, as well as the tutorial, should work
without any changes.

In order to upgrade your device, you need to download the .uf2 file,
and copy it to the TRINKETBOOT disk that appears when you press the
"reset" button (located next to the direction buttons) twice. Once the
file is copied, the device will reboot with the new firmware in place.
