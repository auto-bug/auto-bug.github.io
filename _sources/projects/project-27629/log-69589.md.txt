# Emulating PewPew Lite
Published on 2017-10-22 in {ref}`project-27629`.

I decided to make a quick experiment, before I go on writing the
sprite library and writing proper games for this. I wrote a version of
the "pew" library (needed for the games written for {ref}`project-21578` ) for this device, simulating the 8x8 display with rectangles.

At least the snake game works, didn't try the others yet. I'm
redrawing the whole screen every frame, so the frame rate is not
terrific, but it's playable.
