# Tindie and Repos
Published on 2018-01-27 in {ref}`project-27629`.

I created a product page on Tindie already, for now it has 0 stock,
but at least you can add it to your wishlist: [https://www.tindie.com/products/11372/](https://www.tindie.com/products/11372/) .

I also went and cleaned up the repositories a little bit. All relevant
repositories now live under a single organization at [https://github.com/python-ugame](https://github.com/python-ugame) . I also separated the final ÂµGame 10 designs from all the other
prototypes, so you can easily find all the information in one place,
and not wonder which parts of it are obsolete.\
