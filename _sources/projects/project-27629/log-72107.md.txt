# Final Prototype
Published on 2017-12-29 in {ref}`project-27629`.

The version 8 PCBs arrived from Aisler, together with the stencil, and
it looks great this time!

Please especially note the smooth edges of the board, without any
trace of the panelization tabs. Of course I immediately assembled one
of the boards and tested it:

It works great. Please note the much nicer alignment of the chips, and
the fact that there are no parts under your fingers. One of the
buttons had to be moved a little to the side, but it's actually better
that way.

Of course there were still changes needed, but they are so small, that
I can confidently send the gerber files to the fab without ordering
one more test board. The changes included adding one more debug pad
for connecting VCC, adding holes to the debug pads so that it's easier
to connect probes to them, moving some of the resistors a little to
make them easier to solder, and fixing the stencil to include the pads
for the USB port, and exclude the holes of the power switch
(workarounds for Fritzing's weirdness).

I also wrote the step-by-step testing instructions, and made a test
program:

So everything is ready for fabrication. I will now send all that to
the fab house, and see what they think about it.
