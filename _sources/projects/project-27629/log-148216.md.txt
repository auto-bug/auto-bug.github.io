# Another 3D-printed Case
Published on 2018-06-21 in {ref}`project-27629`.

A while back [@davedarko ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459) made a simple case for µGame and made it available on Thingiverse. Now
there is more choice, as Jovan Maric created another case. This one
works even if you already attached your battery.
