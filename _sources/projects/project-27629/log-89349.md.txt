# OpenSCAD Model
Published on 2018-02-09 in {ref}`project-27629`.

I've been asked about the dimensions of µGame 10, hole sizes and
placement, etc. — so I decided to sit down and update the OpenSCAD
model that I made some time ago for µGame 6. I have put it in the
repository at [https://github.com/python-ugame/ugame-10-hardware](https://github.com/python-ugame/ugame-10-hardware)

You should be able to import it into most 3D modelling software, and
from there you can use it to design cases and all sort of other
things.
