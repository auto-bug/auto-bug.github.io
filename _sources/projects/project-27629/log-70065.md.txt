# Text Layers
Published on 2017-11-04 in {ref}`project-27629`.

Today I spent practically whole day coding, and added support for text
layers to the tile engine. Behold:

Initially I didn't want to add another kind of layer just for this —
it would have to be quite different than the grid layer, as the
squares would be 8x8 pixels and the tile selection would need to be a
whole byte, not 4 bits, plus I only need 4 colors in the font, so 2
bits per pixel...

So I got this idea: what if I make it a standard grid layer, with
16x16 tiles, but then generate a bank that has the text rendered on
the tiles, and just display that. I quickly coded the proof of concept
for that, and it worked, except it was horrendously slow and used a
lot of memory.

So I decided to go for a new layer type after all. Since I only use
128 charcters from ASCII, I made the highest bit switch between two
parts of the palette — so I can have text in two colors. I'm also not
using the 32 control charcters at the beginning of ASCII right now,
but I could put some extra characters in there, things like symbols
for weapons and armor, arrows and buttons, HP and MP, hearts, stars,
cat paws, etc.
