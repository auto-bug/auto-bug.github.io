# CircuitPython 4.0.0 Released, Please Wait for 4.0.1
Published on 2019-05-20 in {ref}`project-27629`.

The CircuitPython 4.0.0 has just been released, and it does include
support for ÂµGame. However, due to last-minute breaking changes in
RC4, and my travelling that made it impossible to fix it over the
weekend in time for the release, the Stage library is broken in that
release and won't work.

So please refrain from upgrading for now.

I'm being told that there should be a version 4.0.1 released next week
or so, which will have it all fixed.
