# Custom Firmware, Flash and Buttons
Published on 2017-10-22 in {ref}`project-27629`.

This board is pretty much the same as Trinket M0, with two notable
differences: it has additional flash for the filesystem, and it uses
more pins than Trinket M0 breaks out. That's why I needed a custom
board definition for CircuitPython, which I made. And it seemed to
work fine, for a while at least. I modified the library for the ST7735
display to optimize it a bit, and started to write a simple program
testing the buttons, when I ran into a problem: every time a soft
reset happened (either because I pressed ctrl+d, or because the board
detected changed files and restarted), it would crash into "safe
mode".

Of course, I assumed this must be the changes I made, so either the
flash handling, or the fact that I don't have a DotStar LED connected
on pins PA00 and PA01, but instead use them for buttons... It took me
a couple of days since I first saw the problem with {ref}`project-21578` to realize what is the real reason for it: the gamepad library that I
added upstream some time ago!

A quick fix for that library to stop scanning keys on restart resolved
the issue, and I have my key test working:

Next I need to write the tiles+sprites engine that I've been thinking
about since at least two years...
