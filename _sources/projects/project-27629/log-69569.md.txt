# Notes for the Next Version
Published on 2017-10-22 in {ref}`project-27629`.

I finished up the second PCB â€” added the switches, the battery
charging, the speaker, and even added a LIR2032 battery on the back. I
will be developing my sprite library now.

Of course the first (well, second, but first physical) prototype has a
number of problems. I will write them down, so that I can fix them
when I make the next version:


 * Make it wider.
 * Center the actual display part of the screen, leaving some margin on
one side.
 * Use smaller buttons and arrange them better.
 * Use a smaller reset switch.
 * Make proper pads for the battery holder, or consider a battery
connector.
 * The parts that have to go on the back should be in the center of the
board, not where you put your fingers. The power and reset switches
can go on top or bottom.
 * Mounting holes under the display make no sense.
 * The pads for the display need to be longer, for more convenient
soldering.
 * Don't cram everything so close to each other.
 * Add analog pin and a voltage divider for monitoring the battery
voltage. Maybe even consider battery protection circuit.
