    This is one of my early experiments at building a cheap quadruped.
Since there are a lot of servomechanisms in such a robot, even when
they are relatively cheap, they comprise a large part of the total
price. So reducing the number of servos is an obvious way of reducing
the price.

However, it's almost impossible to have proper inverse kinematics with
a robot in a spider/lizard configuration with only two degrees of
freedom per leg. Fortunately, in the mammal configuration, when both
degrees of freedom move the leg in the same plane, it's possible to
have two-dimensional inverse kinematics, and that's what this robot
does.

It can move its center of mass, and it can move its legs backwards in
a straight line, and then raise them and move them forward. That is
enough for implementing a proper statically stable "creep" gait.
Unfortunately, it's not enough for implementing proper turning. In
order to turn, this robot works like a tank, by making the steps on
one side shorter than on the other (or even reversing the direction).
This is sub-optimal, as it leads to slippage and unpredictability, but
that's the best I could do without adding at least one servo and
rebuilding the robot completely.
