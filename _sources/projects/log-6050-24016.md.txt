# Out of the Prize
Published on 2015-08-25 in {ref}`project-6050`.

This project is not one of the 100 projects that qualified to the
semifinals of the Hackaday Prize 2015. And no wonder, with 900 of
great projects that entered, the chances were slim. It was still great
fun to participate and I won some very nice swag in the process! Keep
on tracking the contest, as it will only get more interesting with
time.

Of course that doesn't mean anything bad for this project. I would
have worked on it exactly the same (well, maybe I wouldn't put wheels
on the robot or make a dedicated controller) if there was no prize
whatsoever. The real goal is to make it easier for people to get
started with a walking robot and to finally get those robots into our
homes.

If you like this project and its goals, there is a similar one that
qualified, that you can track and support: {ref}`project-6418` . It's on a little earlier stage, but the goals are even more
ambitious!

There are also other robotics projects:


 *  {ref}`project-3800` 
 *  {ref}`project-945` 
 *  {ref}`project-6423` 
 *  {ref}`project-4738` 
 *  {ref}`project-4606` 
 *  {ref}`project-181` 
 *  {ref}`project-7284` 
 *  {ref}`project-1615` 
 *  {ref}`project-6647` 

I will be watching them through the rest of the contest and keeping my
fingers crossed for them. Good luck, and make those robots better for
all of us!
