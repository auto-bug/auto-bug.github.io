# The Buttons, They Do Nothing!
Published on 2015-08-06 in {ref}`project-7111`.

So far, the buttons don't really do anything useful -- they send
"Button n" over the serial. But that is going to change in the future
software updates.

This tiny screen is really too small to see all the information that
you need, so I will need to add a scroll buffer to this device, and
then I can use the buttons to scroll the output.
