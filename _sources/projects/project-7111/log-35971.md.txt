# Nano TTY
Published on 2016-04-15 in {ref}`project-7111`.

While this project pretty much works and serves its purpose, it's not
the most ergonomic design on earth. So I decided to make an even
smaller version, this time with a more thought out user interface. I
called it {ref}`project-10533` , because it's even smaller than the Micro TTY here. It uses pretty
much the same idea, but has an OLED screen for display and a rotary
encoder for scrolling.
