# Chips!
Published on 2017-04-10 in {ref}`project-20941`.

The chips arrived today!

And since I already have the first version of the PCB for the 8x8
matrix, I decided to give it a try, even though that PCB actually
misses two important resistors, and instead connects signals directly
to VCC/GND. So I first tinned both the pads and the chip:

I wasn't supposed to tin the center pad, but a bit of solder got
there, so I spread it as thinly as I could. Next, I placed the chip as
precisely as I could, and heated the pads with my soldering iron, one
by one, until the solder stuck to the sides of the chip. Added flux
and removed excess solder. Ready!

Except the connections weren't very good. I had to re-touch some of
the pads, until I got it to appear properly as 0x96 on the IÂ²C scan.
But some of the rows still weren't displaying, so I re-touched some
more pads and... apparently the solder from the ground pad got onto
the VCC pad -- I have a short in there now, and no way to get to it.

Tomorrow I will go to a hackerspace and use their hot air gun to
remove the chip and solder it properly.
