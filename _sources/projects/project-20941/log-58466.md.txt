# Bi-color 8x8 Matrix
Published on 2017-04-29 in {ref}`project-20941`.

After the IS31FL3728 chip, I tried its larger cousins, but I'm still
struggling getting them to work. They are in 40- and 48-pin QFN
packages, which are pretty hard to solder by hand (in fact, it might
be impossible without a hot air gun and/or a reflow oven). But one of
them, the IS31FL3733 also comes in a TQFP package, and I got one. This
one is too big to fit on a D1 Mini shield, but I made something else:

(Note that the colors are smooth and perfectly fine in reality, but my
phone camera can't handle them.)

This project will have a page of its own soon, but for now it's a good
testing platform for my code. So I made another MicroPython library,
available at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-is31fl37x](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-is31fl37x)  that can handle both IS31FL3733 (for up to 12x16 matrices) and
IS31FL3736 (up to 8x12 matrices).

In the mean time, I'm going to work on those QFN chips, maybe I will
manage to get them to work somehow. Maybe it's just time for me to
invest in a proper rework station?
