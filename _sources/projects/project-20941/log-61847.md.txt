# Grayscale 14x11 Matrix
Published on 2017-06-19 in {ref}`project-20941`.

The IS31FL3733 has double the pins of IS31FL3736, so you get double
fun! This board was also finished and assembled for some time, but I
couldn't get it to work. Today I checked dug it out to try the
capacitor trick, but it already has the decoupling capacitor. But once
I had it out, I did some more experimenting and sure enough, I had the
SDA and SCL pins swapped on it!

This board was pretty hard to route -- it's a lot of pins, and it's
not like they are arranged with any logic. In the end I couldn't find
a way to route the last 4 traces, so I just made two 4-pin headers,
and then connected them with wires. It works, and that's what counts.

The colors in the photos are of course all wrong -- because the camera
sees colors differently than human eye. In reality all the pixels are
red, with different brightness -- not yellow.

I guess now I need to write the code for playing a movie on this, or
at least some animated gifs...
