When I ordered the matrices for the {ref}`project-18120`  project, I found a number of cool matrices that couldn't be driven by
the venerable HT16K33 chip that I used there. I went to search for a
chip that could handle them, [and was pointed](https://hackaday.io/page/2976-alternative-to-ht16k33-for-a-common-anode-bi-color-matrix)  to the IS31FL37* family of chips produced by ISSI.

Those chips are interesting for a variety of reasons. There are
versions for charlieplexed displays, and for driving two matrices
connected in reverse to each other, and for various sizes of regular
matrices. More importantly, they can control the brigtness (or color)
of each LED individually, and they often have interesting additional
effects built-in, such as automatic animations, per-pixel blinking and
"breathing", and some can even modulate the brightness according to
music or other analog input. They are also much more modern -- they
come in very small QFN packages and operate on 3.3V logic.

I requested some samples of those chips, and I will try to design and
build some matrix shields using them. I also plan to do some more
interesting things with them, but we will see how that works when I
actually try.
