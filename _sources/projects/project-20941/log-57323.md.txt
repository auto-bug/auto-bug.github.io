# Custom Footprints
Published on 2017-04-15 in {ref}`project-20941`.

I made the trip to the hackerspace and used their hot air gun, and
desoldered/resoldered the chip properly. I can now confirm that the
resistors that I removed from the example schematic in the datasheet
when designing that version of the PCB were in fact necessary for the
chip to function. Who would have thought! Oh well, I just need to wait
for the other version of the PCB, with all the resistors, to arrive.

In other news, I also received the PCB for the 7x11 matrix and the
IS31FL3736 chip. Unfortunately, there is a small problem with the QFN
footprint that I used (instead of making a custom one based on the
datasheet):

Turns out that just taking a 36-pin QFN footprint and adding the pins
to make it a 40-pin QFN footprint is not enough -- you also have to
scale it down. I have now corrected all my QFN footprints for those
chips to be exactly like in the datasheets, and re-did the PCBs. Of
course it's another couple of weeks until they arrive...
