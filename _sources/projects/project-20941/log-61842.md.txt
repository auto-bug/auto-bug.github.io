# Grayscale 7x11 Matrix
Published on 2017-06-19 in {ref}`project-20941`.

The third chip that I got from ISSI is IS31FL3736. It's very similar
to the IS31FL3733, except it only drives up to 8×12 LEDs. That's
perfect for those 7×11 LED matrices that I got!

I actually designed that shield a while ago, and assembled it when it
came. But it didn't work, at least not reliably -- the chip would
sometimes be visible on the I²C bus, and sometimes not, and sometimes
it would start behaving weird after some time... I put it all to my
poor soldering skills and the really tiny QFN package, and gave up on
it for a while.

Yesterday, after debugging some problems with the IS31FL3733 on the {ref}`project-21578` , which were solved by adding a decoupling capacitor across the power,
I decided to dig out the old board and try adding a decoupling
capacitor to it too. And what do you know, it works perfectly fine
after all!
