# The 8Ã—8 Monochrome Matrix Finished
Published on 2017-04-19 in {ref}`project-20941`.

Well, almost. There is going to be one more version of the PCB,
because_of course_I swapped one of the rows with one of the columns of the matrix.

You can also see that one of the rows has a cold joint in there, but
that was easily fixed.

I also wrote a MicroPython library for this matrix, which is available
at [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-is31fl3728/src](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/micropython-is31fl3728/src) 

I will still need to update it to reorder the rows and columns to fit
the reality -- but I will do that once I get a final working PCB.
