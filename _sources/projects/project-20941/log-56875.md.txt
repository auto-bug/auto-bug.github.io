# The 8×8 Monochrome Matrix
Published on 2017-04-08 in {ref}`project-20941`.

The first shield I'm going to make is a standard 8×8 matrix with red
LEDs, using the IS31FL3728 chip. What's the difference from the
HT16K33-based one then? Well, not much. It's still "on/off" only for
each LED, with a global brightness control. There are two extra
features, related to the analog input pin that this chip has: you can
modulate the brightness of the whole matrix according to an audio
signal, and you can switch it into "equalizer mode" -- not sure what
it does then, but you can guess.

I have the PCBs already, and I should get the chips on Monday. I will
need to do some tricky QFN package soldering then, but I have a couple
of tricks that should work.
