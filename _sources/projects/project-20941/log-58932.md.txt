# PewPew FeatherWing
Published on 2017-05-03 in {ref}`project-20941`.

Apart from making those breakout boards for the D1 Mini (and the
corresponding libraries), I also decided to use the IS31FL3733 chip in
an expansion board for the Adafruit Feather boards, turning them into
a simple game console. However, since that's a little bit different, I
made a separate project page for that at {ref}`project-21578` .
