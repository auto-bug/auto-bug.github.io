# Smaller 8x8 Matrix Breakout
Published on 2017-05-09 in {ref}`project-20941`.

The shields are nice, but not everybody has a D1 Mini, and not
everybody wants to put that matrix on top of their dev board. Sure,
you can just use wires for the shield, but with such a small and
convenient chip, it makes sense to make an even smaller breakout board
-- one that you could tile easily. So I made one that is exactly the
size of the matrix:

I soldered the pin header sideways here, but you can also solder it
normally, and then you can tile the boards easily. I also broke out
the address pin this time, so you can change the I2C address of the
board by connecting it to one of the other pins (you get 4 different
addresses this way).

There is also the audio pin, which you can use to control the
brightness or to feed the built-in equalizer. I will be experimenting
some more with that once the microphones arrive.

I have added the design files and gerbers to the download section, and
you can also order the board from [@oshpark](https://hackaday.iohttps://hackaday.io/hacker/131216)  here: [https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/jGebL1gK](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/jGebL1gK)
