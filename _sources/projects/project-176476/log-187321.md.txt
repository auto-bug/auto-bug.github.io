# PCBs
Published on 2020-12-23 in {ref}`project-176476`.

I could prototype this project now with some Adafruit Feathers and
carboard and wires, using the breakout for the sensor and some tinfoil
for the touch pads, but I decided that I'm lazy, and went right into
the PCB design step. I came up with this:

The "antenna" thing on the top is where you attach a piece of a
silicon hose, so that you can easily replace and wash it if you need
to. There are also six pads for the "holes" â€” two on the back, and
four on the front. Unfortunately that used up all the touch-capable
pins on the SAMD21, so I can't use the DAC pin anymore (it's one of
the touch pins), so at least this version is going to be only a MIDI
controller, with no audio output of its own. There is also no battery
necessary, since it's going to have to be connected to USB anyways,
taking power from there. Depending on how well that works, I might
find ways of adding more features to it later.
