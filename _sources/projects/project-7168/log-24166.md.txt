# Weapons Box
Published on 2015-08-27 in {ref}`project-7168`.

In the universe of Ghost in the Shell, the name "Logikoma" comes from
"logistics robot". Those robots are supposed to be a fast all-terrain
vehicles for transporting weapons and ammo, basically. To do that,
they need some storage space, and that's what the box on their backs
is for.

I just finished making that box for Logicoma-kun. It's empty, and
opens just like in the movie. It consists of several pieces of acrylic
sheet, with paperclips for hinges, all hotglued together.

I might add some magnets there at some point, to make it snap in place
better.
