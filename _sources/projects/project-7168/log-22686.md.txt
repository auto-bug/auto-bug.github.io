# Early Experiments
Published on 2015-08-13 in {ref}`project-7168`.

So this project actually started some time ago with some simple
experiments. First, I modified {ref}`project-6321`  to [walk more like a spider](https://hackaday.io/project/6321-katka-a-mammalian-robot/log/20293-spider-mode) , and then [I added wheels](https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote-affordable-spider-robot/log/20586-logicoma-kun)  to {ref}`project-6050`  to qualify for a prize draw. And that paid off, as in one of those
prize draws I won a coupon for laser-cutting service. Then I decided
to rebuild this robot into a proper Logikoma lookalike, using that
coupon.
