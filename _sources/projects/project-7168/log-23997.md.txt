# Hotglue Everything!
Published on 2015-08-24 in {ref}`project-7168`.

The acrylic nuts and bolts finally arrived, so I can put it all
together. Since I wasn't really sure how everything will be attached
when I designed the laser-cut parts, I simply hotglue them together
where there is no room for bolts.

Next step is connecting all the wires properly and programming. I also
want to try and fit a distance sensor in the eye, and add the hands
and snout.
