# Early Prototypes
Published on 2016-06-27 in {ref}`project-7168`.

I just realized I didn't put here the videos of the early prototypes
that I made to test if the idea is possible.

Here are they, first, the wheeled mode:

And then the legged mode:

Hopefully I will program the final robot soon and upload a video of
its operation.
