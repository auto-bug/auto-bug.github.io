# Reversing a Servo
Published on 2015-12-20 in {ref}`project-7168`.

It's been a long time since I worked on this robot, mainly because I
got stuck with the hands mechanism. You see, I want it to have hands
like the original Logikoma had, and since I have one free servo
channel, I wanted them to move, allowing me to grab things with them.
This gets rather difficult to do if you don't want to make custom
3D-printed or laser-cut parts, and I didn't think about it when I was
ordering the laser-cut chassis.

I finally had this idea -- I can just mount the hands directly on two
servos, and connect both servos to the same signal -- pretty much what
I already do with the wheels. But then there is a tiny complication --
I need the servos to move in opposite directions. There is really no
room to mount one of them up-side down, so I still had a problem.

Then it occured to me. If you open a servo, you will see the PCB with
the electronics, and some leads going to the motor and to the
potentiometer:

Swapping just the motor leads won't work -- the servo will go crazy
and try to move in the opposite direction than it wants. But if you
also swap the potentiometer leads, then all is good again -- both the
motor direction and the position feedback are reversed. Voila, a
reversed servo!

Now all I need is to attach them under Logicoma-kun's body, and
connect to the one servo channel:

Then attach the hands to them, and we are done!
