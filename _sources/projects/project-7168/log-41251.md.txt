# Eye Socket
Published on 2016-07-06 in {ref}`project-7168`.

If you look at the plastic Logicoma toys, you will see that the
"turret" is pretty detailed -- it has all sorts of bolts, handles,
grooves, etc. Mine is smooth, because it's just an acrylic ball. But I
do plan on adding all those details, eventually. I decided to start
with the eye socket, because I have a theory about how to make it, and
I want to test it.

Since the eye hole in the acrylic ball is cut by hand so that the eye
fits in it, I don't know the exact dimensions. So I just placed it
against a piece of acrylic and traced with a pen. Then just added the
details.

Next, some dremeling. Who needs a laser cutter. It's maybe not
perfect, but it's cheap and fast.

Then, I placed the soon-to-be eye socket in a metal ball that I had
lying around (it was a box of chocolates for Christmas or something
like that) and placed it in an oven. When the acrylic softened, it got
this nice covex shape. I adjusted the "ears" manually a little
(careful, hot!), and got something that fits on my acrylic ball just
right (also drilled the holes):\

Next, I drilled corresponding holes in the ball and used the rest of
my plastic bolts to secure it in place.

It's not exactly as in the movies, but I think it's close enough.
