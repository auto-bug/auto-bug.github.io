# New Brains
Published on 2016-06-22 in {ref}`project-7168`.

For a long time I couldn't decide what to use for brains for Logicoma-
kun. The initial experiments were done with Arduino, but I'd like
something stronger and with the possibility of remote programming. For
a time I had high hopes for the WiPy -- I waited for it to be released
and then for the Timer bugs to be fixed, so that I could use it to
control servos. But when it was finally fixed after several months, it
turned out that I can't control enough of them at once easily, and
that programming WiPy over FTP is quite awkward.

Now that the Micropython for ESP8266 is re-done and working great, I
decided to use the old combo: Arduino Pro Mini as a servo controller,
and an ESP8266 module for the main brain. Promptly, I put together the
whole thing on one of my breakout boards:
