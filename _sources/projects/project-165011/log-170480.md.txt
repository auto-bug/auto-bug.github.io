# Lost in Time and Space
Published on 2019-11-01 in {ref}`project-165011`.

I started this project quite a while ago, and it was an unlucky one —
always when the parts arrived, I was in a bit of slump, busy with some
urgent thing, travelling, or just simply burned out. So the progress
was slow, and I only took it as far as assembling and soldering the
whole thing — I didn't have the energy to actually write the software
to test it.

And now I'm bringing it back from the dead, so to speak, to enter it
in this contest, but... I can't find it. I clearly remember assembling
the prototype, but it's not anywhere in my drawers or boxes. I found
the un-assembled PCBs, so I could get another chip and start again,
but I would much prefer not having to do that.

I guess I will need to do a proper cleanup of my workspace.
