# PCB Design
Published on 2019-11-01 in {ref}`project-165011`.

To avoid paying extra for two PCB designs, both layers of the sandwich
are connected at the corner â€” they have to be cut manually for
assembly.

The design above has the copper fills removed for clarity. The antenna
pretty much follows the recommendations from the datasheet. The traces
going to it are kept as short as possible.

To avoid puncturing the ground layer, the connector for the Feather is
made out of an angled male header, soldered SMD-style to the board. In
a final design, a proper SMD header could be used instead.
