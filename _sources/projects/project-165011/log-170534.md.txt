# Discretes and Schematic
Published on 2019-11-02 in {ref}`project-165011`.

I populated the rest of the shield, and its seems to work — at least
it shows up on the I2C bus. Further testing will require writing a
library for it.

I also fixed the schematic view, so that it can actually be
understood. This is something I like about Fritzing — you can do the
schematic later.

While making the schematic, I also discovered that the version of PCB
I have misses one connection (for the I2C address selection
resistors), so I will need to bodge that in the prototype. The final
version has that fixed.
