    The [MGC3030](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MGC3030)  is an integrated capacitive gesture sensor that could be used in a
lot of projects, but unfortunately it has pretty strict requirements
for how the capacitive surface needs to look like. This is an attempt
at providing a ready solution, the sensor with the minimal viable
surface, all as a single FeatherWing suitable for use with Adafruit's
Feather boards.

Because of the requirements for at least four layers that are spaced
pretty far apart, this is actually a sandwich of two PCBs, connected
with pin headers.
