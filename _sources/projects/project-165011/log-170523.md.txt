# Redoing It
Published on 2019-11-02 in {ref}`project-165011`.

I figured that as soon as I start working on it again, I will find the
old prototype. It didn't work, but I did find the chips I had ordered
for it, so I can just make a new one.

Â There are two tricky parts to the mechanical assembly, first is the
FeatherWing header:\

I'm using a feather to get the right spacing and alignment, ad then
just soldering the angled headers to the pads. Finished, it looks like
this:

I had to cut some of them shorter, where the pull-up resistors for the
I2C go. The current version of the PCB has that fixed, as the
resistors are moved to the other side of the header.

Next are the pins that connect the antenna to the main board:

It takes some re-heating and aligning them to fit them in their holes,
but the end result looks good:

Next comes the chip itself:

Now I need to check the values of all the discrete components in the
datasheet and solder them, and it will be ready for testing. That will
probably happen in a week from now, because I will be travelling, and
I can't take it with me.
