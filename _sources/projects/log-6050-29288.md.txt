# PyBoard
Published on 2015-12-20 in {ref}`project-6050`.

There is a version of Tote using PyBoard as its brains: {ref}`project-6877` 

But the code for that was translated from Tote's Arduino code, and
didn't work too well for some reason. I promised to try and fix that
some time ago, but somehow I never got the time for it. Last night I
finally got myself to remove the PyBoard from {ref}`project-3694` , put it on Tote and program.

As the base, I used the micro:bit version of Tote's code, since it's
MicroPython too. I just added the servo-handling code that **@wagner**  wrote for his robot. I also used the same pins, timers and channels.
Since I didn't want to make a custom PCB, I just used the old trick
and connected the PyBoard using dupont cables:
