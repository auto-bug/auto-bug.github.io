# The Swiss Mechanical Keyboard Enthusiasts Meetup
Published on 2019-10-04 in {ref}`project-167897`.

It all started on a Sunday, when I brought my {ref}`project-8282` and {ref}`project-10408` projects to the sixth keyboard pervs meetup. I had my eyes on the low-
profile Kailh switches since a while, but their official website only
lets you order a bag of 800 pieces at the minimum, and I didn't have
the energy to go out and organize a group buy. I even brought my
KB390L keyboard that uses those switches, that is my favorite keyboard
since two years, and that I use daily. But I saw very few keyboards
using those switches, except for this:

I loved the minimalist approach to those keyboards ( [called 5plit](https://oddrocketkeyboards.blogspot.com/2018/05/5plit-v2.html) ), the chocolate switches they use, and the fact that they use the
same PCB for both halves, just flipped over. And the PCB fits in
10x10cm, so it's cheap to manufacture.

I met the author of this keyboard, and learned that he uses it for his
everyday keyboarding needs, even though it started as just a silly
experiment. Sounds really great. I asked if he could sell any spare
PCBs, and he did, so now I have a pair of them. He also told me about
the [Aliexpress shop that Kailh has](https://kailh.aliexpress.com) , where you can buy those and other switches in any quantity you want.
Also key caps and everything else. So I made the order the same day,
for 40 switches and as many transparent key caps, to bring this
keyboard to life.

Today the switches and key caps arrived. I still have the diodes, the
jack sockets and cable, and one of the pro micros (I ran out) on
order, so it probably won't be ready until next month (I go on
vacation too).
