# Up Side Down Handheld Keyboard
Published on 2019-10-04 in {ref}`project-167897`.

One project that I was thinking about since a while is a reversed
keyboard, that goes on the back of a tablet or phone (or any other
device with a screen), so that you can use it with all your fingers
while holding the device. I realized, that if I just soldered the
thumb keys on the other side of 5plit, I could make such a keyboard:

Just imagine a tablet velcroed on top of this. I am still not sure I
really want to do this, but I'm really curious why nobody does it. It
seems such an obvious solution, that there must be some catch that I'm
not seeing. Anybody wants to save me the effort and reveal it for me?

I'm not sure I will do it, but it is very tempting.
