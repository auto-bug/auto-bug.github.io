# Waiting for Diodes
Published on 2019-10-27 in {ref}`project-167897`.

All the components slowly arrived, and now I only have one thing
missing: the diodes for de-ghosting the keys. Unfortunately, this
design uses through-hole diodes, and I only have SMD ones in my
drawers, because I avoid through-hole parts whenever I can. So I had
to order them, and they take a long time. I guess in the worst case I
could solder some wires to the SMD diodes, but I don't really feel
like doing that for 36 diodes.

While waiting for the diodes, I should probably start looking into
programming the pro micros with the right firmware.
