# Only Missing Switches
Published on 2020-10-20 in {ref}`project-174982`.

The PCBs came, and they seem fine. I decided to add some diagonal
strips to one, with a can of spray paint, just for the kicks. Also
soldered all the diodes and the chip, so all that is missing are the
switches, which are still on the boat from China somewhere.

Also, happy to report that the scale is correct this time.
