# First Tests
Published on 2020-10-27 in {ref}`project-174982`.

I have the switches, I assembled the keyboard and testing can now
begin.

First of all, after about a month of using a Planck keyboard, this
feels huge. I can no longer reach the backspace or esc keys without
moving my hands, which is going to affect my touch-typing a bit, I
suppose, unless I remap them to those extra keys in the middle, maybe?

The switches are great, the proportions of the keyboard are fine, and
the layout seems to be working fine. All the keys are where I expect
them. The right shift could be a bit bigger, but then there would be
no room for the arrow keys.

I'm going to use this keyboard for a while now, and see how well it
works for text, code, computer games and graphics programs.

I'm also uploading the design files and the ukeeb example for it, in
case someone wants to try it themselves. The design files are updated,
with nicer, less angular traces and with one missing connection for
the center keys added.
