# The Tricky DPI
Published on 2020-10-01 in {ref}`project-174982`.

Remember how I mentioned that I like this layout, but the keys could
be a bit closer together, and blamed the angles of the columns for
them being too far apart? Turns out the columns are perfectly fine,
the keyboard is just scaled up roughly 10%.

How did that happen?

Well, for designing the PCB outline, and for marking the desired
locations of the switches I used Inkscape. I made sure all dimensions
were correct in that program, using the handy unit switching options
that program has. But as it turns out, Inkscape was recently updated
on my computer, and the new version uses different DPI in the SVG
files it saves than the older one, and than what Fritzing assumes on
import. But it was consistent, so the part outlines exported from
Fritzing didn't get resized, thus the holes for the switches fit fine.
The whole keyboard is just larger than it was supposed to be. The
angled keys only made it difficult to confirm.

I only discovered this just now, while working on the {ref}`project-175043` design. Sure enough, the same thing happened there, so I had to
practically re-do all the routing. Thanks Obama.
