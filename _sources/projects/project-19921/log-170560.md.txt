# New PCB Design
Published on 2019-11-03 in {ref}`project-19921`.

As mentioned, it's time to modernize this design a little bit. So
first of all, I added the PCB legs from {ref}`project-19603` , and also added footprints for contact switches at the ends of those
legs. Then I switched all parts (except for headers) to SMD, because
that's usually cheaper and easier to fabricate. Finally, we have some
additional headers for connecting those foot switches to the Feather's
pins.

The shield remains relatively simple â€” just a PCA9685 for servo
control, and a battery holder with a power switch, and a couple of
extra capacitors. The whole thing fits in 10x10cm, so you should be
able to order it easily, though some fabs might complain about
"multiple projects" in the design.
