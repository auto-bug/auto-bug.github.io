    This is the successor of the {ref}`project-6050`  robot, and its small family ( {ref}`project-9065` , {ref}`project-9927` , {ref}`project-19603` ). Tote itself was focused mostly on affordability, ease of assembly
and extensibility — and I think that it achieved those goals
relatively well. However, it turns out that physically building the
robot and programming the first gait is just the tip of the iceberg.
We need something a little more powerful than a simple Arduino, and
something much easier to program and test. The SpiderWing builds on
top of Tote, but focuses more on the ease of programming and
reliability. It uses slightly more expensive parts (Adafruit Feather
boards, SG92R servos) to be more reliable and easier to reproduce
exactly (whereas every Tote is slightly different from all the
others). It will also use advanced sensors, such as the time-of-flight
distance sensors or the IMU sensors with built-in fusion algorithms,
in order to get better and more consistent results.

Of course the ultimate goal remains the same — to bring walking robots
into our homes and hopefully crowd-source their development, so that
they become reliable and cheap enough to be generally useful.
