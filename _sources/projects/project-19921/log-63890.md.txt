# Repository and License
Published on 2017-07-23 in {ref}`project-19921`.

I just realized that I never linked the repository with the code and
design files in here. I now fixed that mistake â€” you can find the link
on the right, under project's links.

I also added a license file to the repository, so that people can
actually build on top of all this without having to ask me every time.
I've chosen Creative Commons license, because it's a physical object,
not just software, and the software licenses didn't seem appropriate.
