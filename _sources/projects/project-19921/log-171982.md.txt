# Bodgetty Bodge
Published on 2019-12-16 in {ref}`project-19921`.

The PCBs arrived today, so time for some testing. I didn't have any
PCA9685 left, so I had to remove it from one of my oldÂ  {ref}`project-13278` boards. With all the parts in place, time for some test:

And nope, the Feather doesn't get enough power. That's weird. Let's
check the footprint for that battery protection chip again, shall we?
Ah-ha! Here you go, I switched two pins, of course:

Fortunately the bodge is quite easy here. Of course I already fixed
the mistake in the PCB design files. With this small change,
everything is working as intended.

It took some time to assemble the legs, but nothing revolutionary
there. I have all the physical parts assembled, but no time for tuning
and programming it, so it will probably wait for the holidays.
