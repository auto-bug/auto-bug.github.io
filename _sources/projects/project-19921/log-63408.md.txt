# Status Update
Published on 2017-07-19 in {ref}`project-19921`.

The mini-crab version of the robot is as good as it's going to get --
I'm going to leave it as it is for a while, to have something to show
at all the conferences and fairs.

The bigger spider robot still needs work. I will probably need to
shorten its coxas, as this configuration was an experiment and doesn't
seem to work that great. I am happy about the longer tibias though. I
will probably replace the ESP8266 Feather with a ESP32 one, for more
processing power and — hopefully — smoother movement. I'm more or less
happy with the PCB, so I don't think there will be more versions of
it. I will however need to make some sensor shields to stack on top.

The main thing that requires work, as usual, is the documentation.

I also have plans to program the {ref}`project-21578`  board to act as a controller for this robot, but since both are still
in development, it may take some time.
