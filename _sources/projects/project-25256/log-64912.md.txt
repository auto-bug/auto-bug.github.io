# Power Button Fail
Published on 2017-08-09 in {ref}`project-25256`.

The PCB for the power button arrived some time ago, and recently the
last of the parts made it into my mailbox — the pair of mosfets in a
single package. So I went and assembled everything, and powered it up,
and what do you know, it didn't release blue smoke. But it also didn't
work — it was always on. So I went through the schematic again, and
then asked on the hack chat channel for help. Rubber-ducking helped
and I noticed that I have swapped the P and N mosfets in my design.
Ugh. I also tried the PCB on the zero, and turns out it doesn't fit
quite right — the HDMI socket is a little bigger than I thought and
needs a deeper cut out. So here's a new version of the PCB:

Hopefully that one will work better.
