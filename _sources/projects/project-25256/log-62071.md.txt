# Power Problems Solved
Published on 2017-06-23 in {ref}`project-25256`.

A quick PCB surgery, and I cut the trace from near the pin 1 of the pi
connector from display's vcc, and connected that to the nearby 5V
connector that I left there for power. That solved the weird behavior
of the display and the restarts, but it's still making chirping
noises. The images below show the changes:

In other news, I managed to move the whole configuration of the
display into an overlay, and also got the keys work with gpio-keys
driver -- except one of the fire buttons, which uses gpio 7, and which
is a second CS pin for the SPI controller. The SPI driver just won't
give that pin up.

I already started designing second version of the PCB that would use
other pins -- tested working -- but I'm still not entirely sure if I'm
going to be ordering that. De-soldering this display now would be a
little tricky without hot air. I guess it all depends on whether there
are more mistakes to be found in the audio system, which I didn't test
yet.

I'm also still thinking about bet option for powering this. Right now
I'm leaning towards a flat lipo sandwitched between the two boards,
because that would be small, but it's really getting hot in there, so
I'm not sure.
