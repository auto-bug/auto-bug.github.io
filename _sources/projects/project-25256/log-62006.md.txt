# Jumping on the Bandwagon
Published on 2017-06-22 in {ref}`project-25256`.

Everybody and their dog seem to be making retro handheld consoles out
of the pi zero, so I decided it's time to join the party. This one is
mostly inspired by the {ref}`project-21553`  project -- but I didn't have the cool rocker, and I wanted to try a
horizontal orientation. I also used an OLED screen in place of a TFT,
because of better viewing angles. Oh, and instead of the joystick I
used standard buttons. But otherwise it's very similar.

I started by testing the screen. I simply connected it to the SPI port
and followed the instructions from {ref}`project-21553`  about configuring it. Except I used the "pioled" for the display
driver name. I stumbled upon the same bug with rotated display, and I
solved it in the same way -- when that gets fixed, we can both remove
the hacks.

Once I knew the display works, I became confident enough about all the
rest to design and order the PCB.

It's basically just the screen connections, the low-pass filters for
the speakers, and all the rest of pins are connected to the buttons.
And yes, I got a bit wild with the holes. Sue me.
