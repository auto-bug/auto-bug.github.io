# Display
Published on 2017-06-22 in {ref}`project-25256`.

The display is a 128×128 1.5" RGB OLED module, with a SSD1351 chip
that communicates with the Pi over the SPI interface. I'm using the
fbtft Linux driver for driving it, together with fbcp utility to copy
the framebuffers. I have rotated the display 90° to make it fit with
the dimensions of the Pi Zero better -- it only sticks a few
millimeters on either side. Since this is an OLED, and not an LCD, the
viewing angles are excellent and don't really change with the
display's orientation.

I'm using a module and not a bare display, even though I'm making a
custom PCB. That's because the OLED display needs quite a lot of
components, including a voltage boost, and I'm not trusting myself to
get all that right. It's also because I already have the module.

The size of this display, while a bit small, is perfect for the pico8
fantasy game console.
