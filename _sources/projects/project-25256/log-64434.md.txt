# Version 2.0
Published on 2017-07-31 in {ref}`project-25256`.

The second version of the PCB arrived some time ago already, but I was
struggling with the ways to power the raspberry pi and didn't really
try them. Now I confirmed that the new layout of the buttons works
perfectly fine with just the device tree overlay. I didn't test the
memory for storing that overlay yet — there will be a separate update
log for that.

I assembled all three of the PCBs I got from OSHPark this time, and
with the second display I used a low-profile female header, instead of
soldering the module's pins directly into the board — so now I can
unplug the display. I also experimented with two kinds of switches:
the standard through-hole clicky switches, and a weird SMD switch with
very soft and springy action. I'm not yet entirely sure which ones I
like better, to be honest.

Oh, and I still didn't try the audio amplifier either.

Either way, the PCBs work, they mostly use through-hole components for
the basic functionality (minus the sound and the memory), and you can
order them from OSHPark here:  [https://oshpark.com/projects/TfXEKJ7T](https://oshpark.com/projects/TfXEKJ7T)
