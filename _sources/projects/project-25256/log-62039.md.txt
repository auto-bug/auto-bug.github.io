# Display Power Problems
Published on 2017-06-23 in {ref}`project-25256`.

As I'm getting more of it to work and testing with Pico8, I'm starting
to see that I have a serious problem with the display. As soon as
there are white vertical lines on it, it starts making high-pitched
noises and do "tv noise" for some frames, and then the whole Raspberry
Pi hangs.

Looking at the schematic, I think I made a big mistake connecting the
display's power to pi's 3.3V pin. Sure, the display can run both on
3.3V and 5V, and since there is no communication from the display to
the pi, there is no problem with voltage incompatibility. I suspect
that this display takes a bit too much juice for the pi's regulator.

The solution? I will try to un-solder the VCC pin of the display, and
use a wire to connect it to the 5V pins. We will see how that works.
One downside is that won't look so good anymore.

If that doesn't help, there is one more possibility -- the display
drivers in the kernel may be simply buggy, sending to the display some
weird commands that trip it up.
