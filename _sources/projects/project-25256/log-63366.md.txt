# Power Button
Published on 2017-07-19 in {ref}`project-25256`.

Independently from hacking the LiFePO4 power module, I decided to try
and make a small module with a soft power button on it — the same I
linked two logs ago. I will use a thin PCB, so that it can be inserted
between shields.

The schematic is based on several designs from various forums — I'm
not smart enough to figure it out myself. Pressing the button switches
the power on and latches it. Subsequent pressing of the button does
noting, except pulling the GPIO4 down to let the Raspberry Pi know
that we want to shut down. A long press (or pulling the GPIO4 low)
forces it off.

It's a little bit more complex than I'm comfortable with, but we will
see how well it works.
