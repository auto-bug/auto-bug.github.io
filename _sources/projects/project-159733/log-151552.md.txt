# PewPew X Assembled
Published on 2018-08-23 in {ref}`project-159733`.

Thanks to the generosity of [@oshpark](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) , the PCBs for version 10.2 arrived today. I spent the evening
assembling it and updating the code to handle the new button
arrangement. Here it is, with the working scrolling text in all its
glory:

Please excuse the potato-cam that can't really catch the colors
properly, and the dark photo — it's night in here already.

For debugging, I'm using the optional voltage regulator to power it
from USB. I'm still waiting for the battery holders for 2×AAA
batteries. Once they arrive, I can also try experimenting with a
laser-cut piece that will go on the back around the battery holder, to
make the whole thing more comfortable to hold.

I also need to prepare all the materials and start asking fabs for
quotes — this will be the final result of all this work for making it
cheaper.
