# Hardware Design for EuroPython Version
Published on 2019-06-22 in {ref}`project-159733`.

The conference is coming fast, and it's not a secret anymore, so I
took the liberty of publishing all my design files for that version of
PewPew atÂ  [https://github.com/pewpew-game/hardware-europython2019](https://github.com/pewpew-game/hardware-europython2019) 

Electrically it's identical to the 10.3 verson of PewPew Standalone.
Mechanically it's similar to the 10.4, except for the smaller switch
moved to the upper edge, and USB port moved to the upper edge as well.
Well, and the LED and button colors, of course.
