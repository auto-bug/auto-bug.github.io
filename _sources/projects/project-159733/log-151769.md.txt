# Bigger Matrix
Published on 2018-08-26 in {ref}`project-159733`.

So I found this nice 60Ã—60mm matrix in my drawer:

(I think that I previously mentioned a bi-color matrix of similar
size.) In any case, it's a great temptation for designing a PCB for a
bigger version of the PewPew. It would of course be more expensive
(the matrix I'm using right now is a kind of sweet spot, being the
cheapest and the easiest to source), but maybe it would make sense to
have one like that during the workshop, so that the teacher can show
things to the whole group from a distance. Whatever the justification,
for now I just wired it to the small PCB with wires:

It works perfectly fine! I could even mount it in some kind of box,
with the PCB with the buttons below it, to have a pretty convenient
device. For now this is just an experiment, but it's good to know that
I could make such a big version. Maybe one day it will become a badge
for some conference, who knows.
