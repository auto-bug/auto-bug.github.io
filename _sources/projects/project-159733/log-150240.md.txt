# A Prototype
Published on 2018-07-31 in {ref}`project-159733`.

The boards arrived when I was travelling, and now that I am home
again, I can actually work on this again. As a start, I assembled one
of them:

I am still waiting for the battery holders — in the mean time, I used
one that I had available, which has the + and - reversed — that's why
it's soldered wrong. That's actually convenient, because it gives me
access to the programming and reset pins under the matrix. Of course
the final version will have the batteries under the device.

The USB plug works, but I think I made the pads a bit too wide and the
spacing too large — they have a good contact, but it's lost when you
wiggle the device.

I have the CircuitPython firmware with the custom pin definitions and
increased internal disk size flashed. The next step is to write the
matrix-driving code in Python, to test it, and then to rewrite it in C
as part of the firmware, so that it can run in the background. I was
hoping to start on that today, but there was no time this evening.
Tomorrow is a holiday, so I hope to get that working then.
