# Boards Ordered
Published on 2018-07-16 in {ref}`project-159733`.

I just made a few last-minute fixes, and ordered the boards for
DirtyPCBs. Their shipping seems to be working again, and I want to
support them for not caring about how your project is panelized and
how many "distinct" designs there are.

I decided to use white PCBs again, mostly because the matrix's outside
is white too, and because I found white battery holders on Aliexpess.
I used a cheap shipping option, so it will be a few weeks â€” which is
totally fine by me, because I'm going to the Europython conference
next week anyways.

I also added those tiny squares there, which I'm going to glue under
the USB plug. Since the PCB is 1.2mm thick, this will get me to the
required 2.4mm thickness.
