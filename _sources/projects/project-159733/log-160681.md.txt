# Laser Cutting is Tricky
Published on 2019-03-19 in {ref}`project-159733`.

The laser-cut acrylic pieces that I planned to attach on the back of
the small PewPew Standalone boards just arrived, and I have to say I
didn't anticipate how they came out:

Well, at least the shape is correct... but I didn't think the scale
will be wrong. Especially since I actually printed the PDF and made a
wooden model based on that, to make sure everything is good. Oh well,
I guess that's it for ordering laser-cutting from China. I will have
to do it myself.
