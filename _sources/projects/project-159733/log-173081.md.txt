# PicoPew
Published on 2020-01-18 in {ref}`project-159733`.

I don't think I have written about it here yet, but there is one more
member of the PewPew family of devices, and this time it's not made by
me, which makes me really happy. I'm talking about the a project by [@Christian Walther ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/94159) called {ref}`project-167369` . You should go there and read the project logs, I think they are
interesting and very detailed. It's much more powerful device, with a
bi-color matrix with 256 possible colors, esp32-based with TinyPICO
wifi board as the brains, and a really small form factor. I have
obtained a working one by trading both with Christian and with
Unexpected Maker for a {ref}`project-165032`  (one for the shield, one for the TinyPICO).

Here it is all assembled, and with an enclosure that Christian
3D-printed for me:

I still need to get all the software on the device, but so far it
seems to be functioning as expected. I love how the Pew library has
worked here as a kind of a base standard, on top of which more
functionality is built. I didn't anticipate this, but maybe it will
really become a platform.
