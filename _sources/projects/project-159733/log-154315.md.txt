# First Production Unit
Published on 2018-10-11 in {ref}`project-159733`.

I just got a photo from [@ElecrowÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848) of the first unit they produced (a prototype to test the process). The
mass production should commence shortly.

As you can see, I have chosen slightly more lively colors than in the
prototype: the switches are green and the PCB is red. Otherwise it's
all the same. The LED matrix and the battery holder will come
separately, to be soldered by the user.
