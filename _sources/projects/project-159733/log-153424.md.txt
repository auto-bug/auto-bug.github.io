# Big Version PCB
Published on 2018-09-28 in {ref}`project-159733`.

I resisted for a long time, but when three more color versions of the
big 60x60mm LED matrix arrived, I gave up and designed a PCB for them.
You might recall that I already experimented with them before, a few
logs ago, just connecting them with wires. Now I prepared a proper
PCB:

I switched to silicon buttons, like in the {ref}`project-27629` , and a bigger through-hole power switch. Also, the battery holder is
now on the front side (so the whole thing is thinner) and uses inline
configuration of the batteries. There are also two prototyping areas
on the sides, and two large holes for a lanyard if you wanted to use
it as a badge of some sort. The back side is clear (except for the
prototyping areas, of course).

I ordered the PCBs from [@ElecrowÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848) this time, and they have already fabricated and sent it to me, now I'm
just waiting for it to reach me:
