# Mailing List
Published on 2019-03-17 in {ref}`project-159733`.

As the number of users grows, it would be nice to have one central
place for asking questions and general discussion. The CircuitPython
discord channel is one such place, but it's not dedicated, and many
people don't want to use Discord, so there is now a mailing list. The
address is [pewpew@python.org](mailto:pewpew@python.org)  and you can subscribe by visiting [https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pewpew.python.org/](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/pewpew.python.org/) .
