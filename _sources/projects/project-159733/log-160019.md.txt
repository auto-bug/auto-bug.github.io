# CircuitPython 4.0
Published on 2019-03-01 in {ref}`project-159733`.

It's been quiet here for a while, but that is not because nothing was
happening — on the contrary, it's because I have been busy with non-
technical parts of this project. I spoke with several organizations
and individuals who are interested in teaching using this device, and
I had a talk at FOSDEM about it:

Right now I'm working on a secret project related to it — I will let
you know as soon as I am allowed to.

In other news, I was putting off getting all the code cleaned up and
organized, and finally yesterday evening I have bitten the bullet, so
to speak, and upgraded the code to the current master of
CircuitPython, and submitted a pull request upstream:  [https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1607](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/1607)  — hopefully it will get included in the 4.0 release that is coming
soon.

I still plan to split the current repository into small individual
subrepositories, so that it's easier to find the code you need, and
easier to contribute.
