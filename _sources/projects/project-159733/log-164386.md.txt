# Laser-cut Backs
Published on 2019-06-07 in {ref}`project-159733`.

I was making an order at [@Elecrow ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848) again, so I added the order for the laser-cut backs for PewPew again —
this time with the size specified, so that there will be no confusion.
Today they arrived:

They work pretty well, even though the battery still sticks some
millimeter or two. It was the thickest acrylic available, at 10mm. I
could probably stick something rubbery or wooden in there, to get that
last millimeter and to make it nicer to hold. Or actually cut them
from 12mm wood or cork — that would work very well too! A view from
the bottom:

In any case, I'm adding the PDF file to the files section for
download, and I will add an option for this to the Tindie store.\
