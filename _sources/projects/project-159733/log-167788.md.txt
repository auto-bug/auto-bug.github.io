# Workshops in Zürich
Published on 2019-08-25 in {ref}`project-159733`.

The weekend of August 31st and September 1st,  [@Christian Walther ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/94159) and me are going to run workshops on game programming with
CircuitPython using the PewPews.

You will have a unique opportunity of becoming a full-stack game
developer: starting with assembling and soldering your game console,
through a simple bouncing ball tutorial, to a full-fledged game for a
PewPew, all in just 2-4 hours!\
