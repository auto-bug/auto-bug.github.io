# Tutorial
Published on 2018-08-24 in {ref}`project-159733`.

In the mean time I was also working a bit on the documentation. I have
restructured the [ReadTheDocs](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/)  website a bit to allow for different devices, and I have written a
simple [Bouncing Ball Tutorial](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) . Of course that is not enough to actually run a workshop, but it's
enough to get you started writing your own game, hopefully.
