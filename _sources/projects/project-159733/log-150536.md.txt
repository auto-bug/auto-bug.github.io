# Brainstorming
Published on 2018-08-06 in {ref}`project-159733`.

It was a busy weekend, but I did some thinking about the best shape
for this little device. If not for the constraints on price and
preference to not use cables, I think I would like it to look like
this:

Possibly with some kind of a case on the back, to hide the batteries.
But of course that's not possible with the constraints I have, and I
have a very hard time placing the USB plug with the horizontal
version.

I also found some 6x6cm matrices, so it would be possible to make the
same thing, only twice as big. Of course they are quite a bit more
expensive, and the PCB would be more expensive, but maybe it would be
nice to have a bigger version for the teacher? I even started to
design it (it was similar to the one above), but then realized that I
should focus, and stopped. The matrix is ordered, though, so maybe
later.
