 [You can now buy PewPew Standalone directly from Makerfabs](https://makerfabs.com/pewpew-standalone.html) , instead of Tindie. What does it mean for you? Well, for one it is
cheaper, because there are no additional payments and handling along
the way. The shipping is about the same, but you get registered mail
for that price, so it's actually cheaper too. Oh, and it comes already
fully assembled, and in any color you like, as long as it's black.

Personally I am very excited about this, because in practical terms in
means that more people can get their hands on it, and that I'm free to
focus on the support, documentation, more games and the next version.

Big thanks to [@Makerfabs](https://hackaday.io/hacker/268569)  — they helped me with all of my bigger projects, and they have always
been very reliable.
