# Noc Informatyka
Published on 2019-09-27 in {ref}`project-159733`.

This is another secret project that I can now write about. At the
EuroPython I have been approached by the organizers of a Polish event
Noc Informatyka ( [https://nocinformatyka.pl](https://nocinformatyka.pl/) ) and asked to prepare badges for the event. I agreed, and we produced
150 custom units.

Electrically it's identical to the PewPew Standalone, including the
voltage regulator that is optional for Standalone, but included by
default here. Mechanically, I used the same large LED matrix as in the
EuroPython PewPews, but this time with a vertical arrangement of the
device and with quiet silicone buttons, same as used in {ref}`project-27629` . The connector header has been moved to the bottom, to make room for
the lanyard hanger, and there is a place for writing the participant's
name. The battery holder for two AAA batteries is on the back, which
is otherwise empty.

The units were produced and tested by [@Makerfabs](https://hackaday.io/hacker/268569) , and it all went very smooth.

I can't wait to see what the participants of the event will do with
them!
