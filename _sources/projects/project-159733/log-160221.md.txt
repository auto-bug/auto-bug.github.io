# PewPew Pro
Published on 2019-03-06 in {ref}`project-159733`.

I had a friend visiting a while ago, and I showed him my PewPews. He
liked them, but remarked that he wouldn't mind a more feature-full
version (the bi-color display, more shades, more memory) even if it
meant the price would be higher. So I went ahead and designed such a
version:

It's really just re-hashing of the version 5.x of PewPew, but in the
horizontal form factor pin-compatible with the version 10 of PewPew.
Under the display there is the SAMD21 microcontroller, a 2MB flash
memory chip (for the filesystem), and an IS31FL3733 LED driver chip.

Two of the chips come in QFN packages, so they are a bit of a pain to
solder by hand, but I managed to do it without problems this time â€” I
guess I'm getting practice. But I wouldn't want to make much more of
them, and I don't think it makes sense to mass-produce those. So it's
mostly a one-off prototype thing.
