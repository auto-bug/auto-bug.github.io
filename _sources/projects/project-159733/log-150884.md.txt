# My First Charlieplexed Display
Published on 2018-08-13 in {ref}`project-159733`.

Once I got my matrix-driving code working on the PewPew 8.0, it was
just a question of hacking a tri-state gpio pin switching function and
some trivial modifications to get it to work with a charlieplexed
display. At least it seems so, because it looks like it's working:

There is a slight problem with brightness — they are way too bright
now to distinguish individual shades. Of course my phone camera got
overloaded and did something funny with the colors, to the naked eye
they are all blindingly red. I will need to tune the PWM somewhat.

I'm powering it with a bench power supply for testing, because the
poor little coin cell only lasts a few minutes with the display on at
full power — even though the bench supply claims it's only drawing
20mA total.

We will see what I can do with it, but it definitely looks promising.
