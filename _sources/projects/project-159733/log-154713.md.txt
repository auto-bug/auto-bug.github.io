# Big Version Assembled

The PCBs finally arrived from [@Elecrow](https://hackaday.io/hacker/147848) , so I assembled one to see how it works:

Generally I'm pretty happy with it, there are however two small things
that I would correct in the next version:


 * the direction buttons are too close to the matrix, and it's awkward to
press the right button,
 * the holes for the matrix are a bit too far apart, so you have to bend
the matrix legs a bit to fit, but it also makes them fit tighter, so
I'm not sure about this one.

Otherwise it looks and works great, and I think I'm going to put some
of them for sale on Tindie. Here's how they look like under the hood
(while being programmed):
