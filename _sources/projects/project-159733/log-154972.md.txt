# Small Version Available on Tindie
Published on 2018-10-21 in {ref}`project-159733`.

The small PewPew has been just approved on Tindie, so you can order it
already. The package will arrive tomorrow, but the approval process
takes some time, so I started earlier. I wouldn't be able to send it
on a Sunday anyways.

If you need a larger quantity for a workshop, contact me directly, and
we can arrange it.

The product on Tindie still has the photos of the prototype â€” the
final version has a red PCB and green buttons. I will update the
photos when the package arrives. The final price is also a little bit
higher than I initially anticipated, due to the duty tax.
