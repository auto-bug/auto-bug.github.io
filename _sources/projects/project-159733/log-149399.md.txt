# First Attempt at Routing
Published on 2018-07-15 in {ref}`project-159733`.

Since I couldn't sleep this night, I took a stab at routing this 16×8
matrix. I decided to split it in two parts, one 7×8 and one 9×8,
rotated by 90° — this time I have the whole thing covered with 17
pins, but I can scan the whole thing in just 8 steps instead of 12. I
only had 16 free pins, but I re-used the programming/debugging pins
(with a jumper to disconnect them from the LEDs for programming). I
also fixed the USB plug and made the button pads a bit bigger.

I still don't look forward to soldering the prototype manually...
