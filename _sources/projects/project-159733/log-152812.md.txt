# Controlling a Robot
Published on 2018-09-13 in {ref}`project-159733`.

The Maker Faire Zürich is coming, and I need to show something. Sure,
I could just let people play some games, but it's always cool to have
something moving. Last year I had the {ref}`project-20379` controlled with {ref}`project-19371` , this time I decided to use the PewPew to control a {ref}`project-181` .

The connections are rather simple, even if there is a lot of them —
every servo gets its own GPIO pin, and power from the powerbank.
Tested the servo movements with the REPL, and it all seems to be
working fine. Now I need to write some simple code to control them
with the buttons, and maybe to display some status on the display...
