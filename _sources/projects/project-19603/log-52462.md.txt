# Surprise PCBs
Published on 2017-01-26 in {ref}`project-19603`.

This is the effect of my brainstorming about the best board to use for
Tote's brains. I initially choose the D1 Mini board, and designed a
couple of PCBs to use it. However, I did that late at night, and in
the morning I didn't remember that I ordered one of the designs. Then
I changed my mind and decided to use the Adafruit Feather boards
instead. A few weeks later I received the surprise PCBs. Since I
already have them, I might as well just built and program it --
especially since the code is going to be the same for both versions of
Tote anyways, and I'm still waiting for the other PCBs.
