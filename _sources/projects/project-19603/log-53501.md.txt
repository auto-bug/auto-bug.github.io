# Smaller ATmega
Published on 2017-02-18 in {ref}`project-19603`.

The ATmega8 chips arrived, and I decided to try and see if my servo
controller code will run on it equally well as on the ATmega328p that
I used previously. After soldering it to the PCB (I'm getting better
at it) I edited the Makefile to change the target, ran it and... got
errors. Looks like a couple of registers got renamed, so I took the
datasheets, compared them and made the appropriate changes. This time
it compiled, so I flashed it to the chip, and... it doesn't work. I
looked again, and realized that the fuses are completely different for
this chip! To the avr fuse calculator. I changed the fuses in the
makefile, flashed again and... it works!

I still need to properly debug and finish the Python code for walking
-- the last weeks were a bit too busy to setup the testing and focus
on this properly, but I hope I will get it done soon.

By the way, I also received the PCB for the {ref}`project-19921`  -- the Feather version of this. I'm going to be developing them both
in parallel for now.
