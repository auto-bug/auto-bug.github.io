    This is the next step of evolution of {ref}`project-6050`  and {ref}`project-9927` , the spider robots that were designed to be as simple and easy to
build as possible, without sacrificing the proper walking algorithms.
This time the focus is on making it easier to program and to modify by
attaching additional hardware.

While Tote was focusing on building a proper quadruped robot without
special materials and tools and as cheaply as possible, the subsequent
projects focus on making the robot more reliable and easier to
experiment with. The {ref}`project-19921` project loosens the budget constraints, aiming to make a sturdier,
stronger and more consistently reproducible robot. This project works
in parallel to that, trying to incorporate the same improvements, but
without rising the price too much. The two projects are meant to cover
the conflicting needs of hobby robot developers.

Of course, the overarching goal for both of them is to stimulate
research in affordable and reliable legged robots, so that we can have
devices like this at our homes one day.

## Instructions




### Mechanical Assembly


For mechanical assembly, follow the instructions at [http://tote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly_v5.html#legs](http://tote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly_v5.html#legs) 


---



### Electronics


Solder the headers, PWM chip and resistors onto the board. Add the
power switch and battery holder. Connect the servo plugs.


---



### Programming


Copy the python code from project's repository onto your D1 Mini using
Adafruit's Ampy utility. Plug the D1 Mini into the PCB.


---



### Extending


Use the D1 Mini's headers to add shields with sensors and other
components to the robot. Modify the code to take advantage of them.
