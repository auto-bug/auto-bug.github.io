# Debugging
Published on 2017-01-29 in {ref}`project-19603`.

I have the little guy assembled (I stole the legs from my first Tote
prototype), and it works quite well. However, software is the hard
part.

First I had to remap the servos in my servo controller firmware to
make them agree with what's written on the PCB -- that should make it
much easier to debug everything in the future. I also wrote the Python
side of the communication with the servos, and there I had my first
problem -- when sending the servo positions too fast one after the
other, I get bus errors. For now I just catch them and retry, but I
suspect I will need to increase the clock stretching timeout.\


Second, the Python code for Inverse kinematics -- I used the original
code that I have written years ago for {ref}`project-3300` , and it seems to work without problems. Yay. Except for some stupid
mistakes I made, like multiplying everything by 0, which of course
took me hours to find. Oh well.

The gait code is more problematic though. I used the code I wrote for {ref}`project-9927` , but it doesn't seem to be behaving exactly as I wanted. I'm still
figuring out what is wrong -- it's probably something trivial like a
reversed angle somewhere or a leg going out of range -- but no success
yet.
