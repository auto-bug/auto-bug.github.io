# Prototypes on Sale
Published on 2018-06-27 in {ref}`project-159022`.

This was a pretty quick project, but it's also really simple. I have
the three PCBs I got from OSHPark assembled and on sale at Tindie. I
also ordered proper PCBs now (white), and I will sell them on Tindie
as kits when they arrive.

The PCB design is now published at OSHPark, so you can also make your
own.
