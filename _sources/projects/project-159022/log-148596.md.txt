# Production PCBs
Published on 2018-07-01 in {ref}`project-159022`.

The initial prototype PCB worked great for singles, but now I want to
start selling kits, so I need to panelize them. Initially I just
slapped a few of the boarrds together and added a few tabs to connect
them, but when I submitted that to be fabricated, it got rejected. So
today I sat down and panelized them properly:

I could probably pack them denser, and get less problems with the
"mouse bites" somehow, but I think this is good enough for now. This
will give me 160 PCBs in total. I varied the silkscreen on them
slightly, to give them different facial expressions. Ordered them on
white PCB with black silkscreen. Should arrive in a few weeks â€” in the
mean time I need to figure out how to package the components, in
particular, how to mark the colors of the LEDs.
