After making {ref}`project-7860` I wanted to explore the rainbow wires theme a bit more, but this time
with something original, that I could actually get out to people
without having to worry about copyright infringement. I also wanted to
make it a little bit more useful.\


After playing a bit drawing various dumb unicorns, I remembered that I
actually like tentacles, and that there are many see creatures that
are colorful and shiny. So I decided on a jellyfish.

The idea for the device is very simple: you just have a bunch of LEDs
with matching resistors, colored the same as the wires coming out the
bottom, except for the ground wire, which is common for all LEDs
(that's fortunate, since there are no brown or black LEDs). What is is
good for? You basically connect it to your breadboarded projects to
see the signals on the pins. You want to test the blink program on a
new microcontroller? Easy!
