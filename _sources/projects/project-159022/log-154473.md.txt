# Videos!
Published on 2018-10-14 in {ref}`project-159022`.

I didn't write about it, but a while ago [@davedarkoÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/3459) agreed to make a video about soldering this project, and you can watch
it on YouTube here:

There is now a second video, made by [@blitzcitydiy](https://hackaday.io/hacker/248434) , and you can watch it here:

It really makes me happy to see that people care about something I
made to make a video about it unprompted. I also love the professional
quality and clarity of both of those videos! They are really well
done.
