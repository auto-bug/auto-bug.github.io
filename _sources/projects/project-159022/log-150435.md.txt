It took me longer than anticipated — a couple of events in the middle
of it got in the way — but the Rainbow Jellyfish kits are now in stock
on Tindie. You can get them here:  [https://www.tindie.com/products/13347/](https://www.tindie.com/products/13347/)

The LEDs are dabbed in paint to show what color they are. I used SD
card boxes for the kits — was considering paper bags with printed
instructions instead, but this turned out to be easier and required
less work. Also looks better.
