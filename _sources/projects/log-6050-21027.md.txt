# Cheap Chinese STM32 Boards
Published on 2015-07-16.

We already saw that Tote can work with a Pro Mini, Pro Micro or Teensy
3.1 as its brains. The Teensy is especially interesting, as it gives
us a lot of pins for additional sensors and effectors. But it's quite
expensive. Could we maybe use a cheaper ARM board instead?

Turns out we can. Digging through my parts box, I found a "blue pill"
board that I ordered some time ago from China for $4. It's an STM32
Cortex-m3 microcontroller on a relatively small development board. A
little bigger than Teensy, but still compatible with the 600mil DIM
sockets, so the same as the Pro Minis and Teensy. Of course, the
pinout is not compatible, so I would need to make a custom board, or
do the same trick I did with Teensy -- use wires to connect to the
right pins.

But how do I program it? Do I need a JTAG programmer, a complex setup
for cross-compiling to ARM and a complicated GDB configuration? Turns
out that I don't, because there is the [stm32duino](http://www.stm32duino.com/)  project! And they even have a step-by-step YouTube video on how to
program that board:

Turns out it's very simple and works like a charm. They also have the
pinout of that board [on their forum](http://www.stm32duino.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=117) :

That should make it all much easier. Unfortunately, that pinout
doesn't say which pins support PWM and thus are suitable for use with
the Servo library. I had to get them by trial and error, which is what
I spent the bulk of my time on. But ultimately I came up with a
working set of pins, which I put in the [servo.ino](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/commits/162ec23c4fbeadc1ddd0feea622ca22ff2a53662)  of the code that worked for Teensy 3.1. And it works. I will skip the
video this time, because it looks exactly the same as the one with
Teensy, so you can go and watch that one instead.
