# To do it, to do it, to do it...
Published on 2017-09-01 in {ref}`project-27033`.

After a hint from [@limorÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/45459) about a reset pin and some experimenting, I decided to re-do this PCB,
this time properly, following all the rules.

So the reset pin is now tied to the board's reset. That frees up one
digital pin, which I can now use for chip select, instead of having it
pulled down permanently. Because the Trinket M0 doesn't have a pull-up
resistor on its reset pin, I had to add one.

The second resistor is for the LED back-light, so you can pick the
right one for the brightness you desire.

Finally, I added a filter capacitor to the display's power, for good
measure.

I also fixed the mounting holes and added a logo. The logo is up-side-
down in relation to the text on the board, but I only noticed it now
and who looks at those things anyways.
