# Assembled and Programmed
Published on 2021-11-07 in {ref}`project-180025`.

Over the weekend I finally had time to finish assembling the robot,
and to program the S2 Mini for it. No, I still didn't implement a gait
— just the IK code I had before.

Surprisingly, there were no problems with the PCB — other than the
lack of room between the battery and the servo sockets that I
mentioned previously. I even got to test the battery protection
circuit, because unfortunately those servo sockets make it very easy
to short-circuit the cables:

See, the right-most servo cable, that got a bit skewed, and the
contacts shorted all the wires together.

Extra care needs to be taken to align the cables straight when doing
this.
