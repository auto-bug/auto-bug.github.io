# EasyEDA
Published on 2022-10-02 in {ref}`project-180025`.

Because some people seem to have some kind of grudge against Fritzing,
I decided to re-do the PCB for Fluffbug in EasyEDA, so that it can be
easily ordered from JLC. They don't have all the parts (in particular,
all 1kΩ resistors seem to be out of stock for some reason), but you
can probably get those from somewhere else.
