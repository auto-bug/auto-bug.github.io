# Better Gait
Published on 2022-07-19 in {ref}`project-180025`.

I took the robot with me to the EuroPython 2022 conference, hoping
that I will have some time during the maker hacking sessions or during
the sprints to work on the code further. And I did manage to improve
the gait considerably:

There is of course still a lot of room for improvement. I need to
rewrite the code to make it more modular and maybe make use of the
async features of CircuitPython. I also need to think about how to
move the servos more fluently, possibly along defined motion profiles,
to give the robot a more organic look (and put less strain on the
servos too).

Then, I will work on a remote control program for the {ref}`project-178061` console, to control the robot over WiFi or ESPNow.
