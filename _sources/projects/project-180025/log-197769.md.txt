# Inverse Kinematics
Published on 2021-09-13 in {ref}`project-180025`.

While I'm working on re-doing the PCB to incorporate all the recent
changes, we can talk about the hard part: programming. Obviously,
without a program the robot is useless, and if you want the robot to
do anything, most of the work is going to be writing the program for
it. This is why I'm trying to make this part as hassle-free as
possible, switching to a high-level language like Python, and using a
variant of it, CircuitPython, that makes it especially easy to modify
any code, by exposing it as an USB drive. Another thing I can do so
simplify things is to provide libraries that handle the low-level
details, and expose a higher-level interface to the user's code.

One of the details I can handle is Inverse Kinematics — that is,
translating between the desired positions of the robot's legs, to
actual angles the servos need to move to. This is a little bit simpler
with the eight servo configuration than it was with the twelve servos
of Tote, but it's still a little bit of tricky trigonometry.

Let's look at a side view of the robot:

We can see that each leg forms several triangles: a right-angle
triangle formed by the coordinates of the tip of the leg, that lets us
calculate a part of the angle of the first servo and the distance of
he tip of the leg from the first servo, and the triangle ABC, which we
then know all the dimensions of, and which gives us the remaining
angles.

So basically we need the Pythagorean Theorem, and then the Law of
Cosines. In code, it looks like this:


```python
        leg_length2 = x * x + y * y
        leg_length = math.sqrt(leg_length2)

        hip_leg_angle = math.acos(
            (FEMUR2 + leg_length2 - TIBIA2) /
            (2 * FEMUR * leg_length)
        )
        knee_angle = PI2 - math.acos(
            (FEMUR2 + TIBIA2 - leg_length2) /
            (2 * FEMUR * TIBIA)
        )
        hip_base_angle = math.atan2(y, x)
        self.angles(hip_base_angle - hip_leg_angle, knee_angle)
```

We can add some error checking for out-of-reach points, some
convenience code that lets us move by increments and flips the y
coordinate, and we have a working leg.
