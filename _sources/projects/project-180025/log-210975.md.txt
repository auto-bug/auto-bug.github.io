# Version 6
Published on 2022-09-16 in {ref}`project-180025`.

When I recently started looking for parts to make more of those
robots, I had an unpleasant surprise: the battery protection chip that
I used, HT3062E, can no longer be easily bought. That is a big
problem, so I went to look for another chip instead. Unfortunately,
there don't seem to be very many integrated solutions out there – most
chips require separate mosfets, which is something I would rather like
to avoid. So this time I went for the DW07D, which is for a bit lower
current, but should still work. Unfortunately it comes in a different
package and requires different connections, so a new PCB design is
required.

I also added a mosfet for the speaker, and some handles at the top of
the PCB, to make it easier to attach things to the robot.
