# Maker Faire
Published on 2022-09-15 in {ref}`project-180025`.

Fluffbugs went to Hannover last weekend, together with some other
bots, game consoles and a bunch of keyboards. We had a table labeled
4/5 Stars, and you could see all our stuff there.

Since Fluffbug still mostly just walks forward, most of the work was
done by the two {ref}`project-6050` robots I also brought. But a lot of people stopped by to see them
walking around.

Afterwards, I had some fixing to do.

My main Fluffbug now has two new servos, which don't quite match the
rest, but I think I like it.

I also recharged all the batteries.
