# First Steps
Published on 2022-03-13 in {ref}`project-180025`.

Today I decided to make this robot walk, however awkward a walk it
will be. I didn't write the code for smooth movement of the servos, so
it's all jerky and crude, but it is something.

The most important change now is to make the tiling of the body
smoother. Right now it's really unacceptably sudden, and since it
moves the whole robot, it puts a lot of strain on the servos. Next
will come fine-tuning of the step size and movement speed. Once I have
it all reasonably smooth, I will experiment with turning.
