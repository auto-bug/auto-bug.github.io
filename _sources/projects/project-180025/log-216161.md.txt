# Bits'n'Bolts Robot Workshop
Published on 2023-02-20 in {ref}`project-180025`.

I might have mentioned this already, we are preparing a workshop here
in Zürich for building a bunch of Fluffbug robots:  [https://www.bitsnbolts.ch/programm/fluffbug-robot-workshop](https://www.bitsnbolts.ch/programm/fluffbug-robot-workshop) . You have to register, because the number of places is limited, and
you also have to pay for the workshop separately from the the main
event, but I hope it will be worth it.

As you saw in the previous log, I'm working on clear assembly
instructions, but we also need to prepare the kits. Almost all parts
have already arrived, but I'm still waiting for the servos – that is
going to be a big box.
