# Version 3
Published on 2021-05-26 in {ref}`project-180025`.

The previous two versions of this projects were kinda done on the side
of {ref}`project-158981` to see if this approach even makes any sense. I finally decided to go
for it, so here is a version three, with a new PCB:

and an improved design of the legs (to make them use less acrylic, so
you can fit more of them on a sheet):

The PCB now includes, apart from the previous microcontroller, battery
protection, battery charging and battery holder, also a tiny buzzer
and a place to install an IR sensor â€” this way I can report the status
of the robot with beeps, and control it with a TV remote.

Any further sensors and other hardware can be added as FeatherWing
shields to the front of the robot.
