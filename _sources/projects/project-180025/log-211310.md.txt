# Version Six Assembled
Published on 2022-09-25 in {ref}`project-180025`.

The PCBs arrived, and I assembled everything. One thing that didn't
work was plugging the S2 Mini into the staggered holes directly - you
need headers for solid connection. Oh well. Another problem was the
overcurrent protection of the new chip, that triggered whenever all
the servos moved. Replacing one of the resistors with a bigger value
one fixed this.

Sadly, I still didn't get the camera module working correctly, even
with the new shield. Oh well.

I used the PCB legs with switches, but I didn't connect them yet.
