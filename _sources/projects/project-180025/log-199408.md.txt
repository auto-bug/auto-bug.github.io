# Version 4 of the PCB Routed
Published on 2021-10-24 in {ref}`project-180025`.

It were busy few weeks, but now it's finally all over, and I had some
time to finish the version 4 PCB. It turned out to be much simpler
than anticipated â€” the difficult part was figuring out which pins I
can use, and that I did already previously. So I ended up with a
simple board like this:

I have to say that I forgot how much using a ready development board
simplifies the design. It's basically just connecting things together,
and a little bit of more complexity around the power.
