# Version 8.2 of the PCB
Published on 2023-01-19 in {ref}`project-180025`.

Along with migrating to all-SMD components (except for the battery
holder), I also migrated with my PCB designs from Fritzing to EasyEDA.
It's not as conductive to experimenting and just playing with things,
but at least it's not openly hostile to it like KiCad is, and comes
with a huge library of footprints.

Because of that, the latest version of the PCB is published at  [https://u.easyeda.com/account/user/projects/index/detail?project=ec4ce
18f172848fc80a110ab474689c6](https://u.easyeda.com/account/user/projects/index/detail?project=ec4ce18f172848fc80a110ab474689c6)  together with the schematic and the BOM. However, be careful about
the female pin headers, you probably want to get some low-profile ones
instead of those used in the footprint.
