# Home Button for Keyboards

Use phone's trackpad as a pointing device.

    It's a common practice in custom keyboards to include some kind of a
pointing device on them, so that we can move the mouse cursor without
having to take the hands off the home row. A variety of devices are
used: analog joysticks, thinkpad trackpoints, small trackballs. But
some phones have a device that would be ideal for this: the "home"
button with a built-in optical trackpad.

Unfortunately, even though you can easily get those buttons as
replacement parts, nobody seems to be using them â€” and that is
probably because there seems to be very little documentation.

I decided to try and reverse-engineer one particular model of such a
button, document it, and use it to build a module for my {ref}`project-175712` .
