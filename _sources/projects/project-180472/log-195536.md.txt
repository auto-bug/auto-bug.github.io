# Second PCB
Published on 2021-07-19 in {ref}`project-180472`.

The PCB breakout for the 8350 sensor arrived from [@oshpark ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) and as always it looks great:

Unfortunately I miscalculated the distance between the socket and the
slot, not taking into consideration the thickness of the PCB, so I had
to use a file to make the slot a bit bigger:

That is fine, because this breakout is just for experimenting — the
final one will have correct dimensions and only the pins that are
needed.

I have everything soldered up and prepared, but I didn't yet have time
to actually try this sensor yet — hopefully I can do it tomorrow.
