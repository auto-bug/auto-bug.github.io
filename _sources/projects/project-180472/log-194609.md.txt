# Power On
Published on 2021-06-23 in {ref}`project-180472`.

I was right about motivation from the updating of the project logs —
right after I finished the last log, I decided to continue the
exploration. So I took a piece of paper and I figured out which pin is
connected to which pad:

Then I connected the power to the VCC and GND pins, and measured the
voltages against GND and against VCC on all pins, hoping that maybe
this will give me some insights. The results are a little bit weird,
so I decided to also try and measure the resistance between all pins
and VCC and GND — of course with the power disconnected.

The results were even stranger, so I repeated the same procedure with
the second module, and got completely different results.

My suspicion so far is that it's indeed very hard to get those pads
soldered properly without shorts and breaks, and that I did a poor job
with it.
