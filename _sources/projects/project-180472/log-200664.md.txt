# Prior Art
Published on 2021-11-25 in {ref}`project-180472`.

Apparently someone had the same idea as me, but also had the skill and
energy to pull it off:Â  [https://github.com/vlukash/corne-trackpad](https://github.com/vlukash/corne-trackpad) 

I think I'm going to steal from that project.

Looking at it, I see that I made a huge fundamental mistake, assuming
a 2.8V device will work just fine with 3.3V. Turns out those optic
sensors are very particular about their voltages, so time to invest in
level shifters.
