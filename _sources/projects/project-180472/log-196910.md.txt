# Another Failure
Published on 2021-08-22 in {ref}`project-180472`.

I finally had the time to try my new breakout. I was putting it off
because deep inside I felt there is no chance it can work with the
horribly inconsistent schematic and pinout I based this on. And sure
enough, it doesn't. I wrote a very simple program to test it:


```
import board
import digitalio
import time

rst = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.A4)
rst.switch_to_output(value=False)

cs = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.A5)
cs.switch_to_output(value=False)

spi = board.SPI()

spi.try_lock()

buffer = bytearray(1)
while True:
    spi.write(b"\x00")
    spi.readinto(buffer)
    print(buffer)
    time.sleep(1)
```

This should, in theory, print a string of \x0d on the screen. But of
course all it prints are \x00. I tried some combinations of pulling
down or up various pins that were ambiguous in the schematic that was
posted, but I didn't manage to make it return anything else than \x00
or \xff.

I might try some more experimenting with it still, but for now it's a
huge disappointment.
