There is one other attempt at using this kind of sensors that I know
of. It's an old post on the Arduino forum, together with a YouTube
video with the demonstration, and a few missing images:  [https://forum.arduino.cc/t/blackberry-joystick-navigation-key-
hack/61454/12](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/blackberry-joystick-navigation-key-hack/61454/12) 

In this case a button from Blackberry 8520 was used, which has a very
fancy connector, similar to those used sometimes for displays. The
sensor itself seems to use SPI protocol and registers very similar to
mouse sensors — which makes a lot of sense, since it is basically the
same sensor as in an optical mouse, only with different optics and
physical shape.
