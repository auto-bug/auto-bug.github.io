# A New Plan
Published on 2021-06-24 in {ref}`project-180472`.

I tried to fix the connection between the flex PCB and the PCB, but it
looks hopeless. I ended up ripping the pad off of one of the sensors.
I think I need to re-think this.

At this point, the easiest way forward seems to be to find the correct
mezzanine connector for the Blackberry 8520 sensor — after all I even
have a ready pinout for it! After some searching, it seems that
something called DF30FB-20DS-0.4V should fit. I have ordered it, and
we will see.

In the mean time, I can prepare the footprint for it. The datasheet
gives me a recommended pattern:

Replicating this in Inkscape just takes a few moments:

Now I just need to quickly design a PCB, and hopefully the connector
and the PCB will both arrive at about the same time.
