# CircuitPython
Published on 2022-05-13 in {ref}`project-185291`.

The board definition and code is now merged into the CircuitPython
project, and both the bootloader and the firmware can be downloaded
from  [https://circuitpython.org/board/pewpew_lcd/](https://circuitpython.org/board/pewpew_lcd/)  (or rather, the firmware will appear here as soon as there is a
release). Thank you to the CircuitPython developers for reviewing and
merging it so fast.
