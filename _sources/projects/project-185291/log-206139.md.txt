# Version 2.1
Published on 2022-05-14 in {ref}`project-185291`.

Today I couldn't sleep, so I did what I do when I can't sleep:
designed a PCB. As I previously mentioned, version 2.0 is very close
to what I want, but there were some small details I wanted corrected.
Those changes are not really enough to warrant a whole new version,
and I'm not going to do a new certification for it.

I removed the unused resistor footprint, and moved the capacitors away
from pads, so that they don't get in the way. I centered the display,
so it will now fit the outline properly. I moved around the traces for
the touch pads, so that you are less likely to touch a trace and
activate a touchpad when you didn't mean to. I removed the doodles to
make it look a bit cleaner, and on the back I added a place to sign
the device, to make it more personalized. I also covered the expansion
connector pads with soldermask, so you are less likely to touch
exposed solder with your fingers.

I will order the PCBs from [@ElecrowÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/879772) once again, and I will publish the design files once I have tested and
verified that they work.
