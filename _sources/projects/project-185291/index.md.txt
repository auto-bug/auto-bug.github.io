    Teaching programming is hard. And it's not made any easier by the fact
that before you even start teaching, you have to first do the
ungrateful job of an IT support worker and get your students through
all the hoops of installing all the necessary software and libraries
on their computers. And when you finish, the programs they have
written only works on their own computers, unless they go through all
the same (and possibly some additional) hoops.

The PewPew family of devices is one possible answer to this. They are
designed with one main goal in mind – to remove as many obstacles
between your students and the game they want to create, as possible.
To achieve that goal, the device itself has Python running on it – a
version of Python designed for microcontrollers, called CircuitPython
– so all you have to do is edit the files on it, using any text
editor, to write your programs. As soon as you save, the device
restarts and runs your code. In addition, if you want to show your
game to other people, or enjoy it on the bus, you can simply put it
into your pocket.

This is one of many devices in the family – I started with {ref}`project-21578` and as I tried it in different workshops, I refined the design with {ref}`project-159733` , {ref}`project-165032` , {ref}`project-177306` , {ref}`project-178061` and   {ref}`project-180309` . So far the standalone version has been the most successful, being
simple and affordable, but later experimenting showed me that there is
room for improvement.

This time I want to design a device that is even simpler and cheaper
than any previous one, while at the same time being more convenient to
use, and maybe helping us find a use for some of the old electronic
spare parts that lie around.

## Instructions




### Fabricate the PCB


Use the provided gerber files to get the PCBs fabricated. Use 0.6mm
thickness of the PCB. Lead-free or gold coating recommended, as the
device will be touched by hands.


---



### Populate the PCB


Solder all the components. The QFN chip can be soldered by drag-
soldering the edges, though a hot-air gun or hot-plate are recommended
for convenience. All the other components are easily soldered by hand.


---



### Flash the Bootloader


Get the UF2 bootloader from the link in the hardware repository
readme, and flash it onto the microcontroller using a JLink programmer
or compatible. The SWD and SWC pins are marked 1 and 2 on the
connector at the bottom of the device. VCC is marked + and GND is
marked -. Use a 12-pin male header to friction-fit it into the
connector and a breadboard for a reliable connection while
programming. Power can be provide through the USB connector, make sure
the switch is in the USB position.


---



### Flash the Firmware


Once the bootloader is flashed, a PEWBOOT disk will be available over
the USB. Download the latest CircuitPython firmware from
circuitpython.org and copy it over to that disk. The device will reset
and the CIRCUITPY disk will become available.


---



### Install the Menu and Games


Copy the main.py file from the software repository, and copy any game
files from the pewpew github onto the device.


---



### Ready


Safely remove the USB disk, and disconnect the device. Insert a
battery.
