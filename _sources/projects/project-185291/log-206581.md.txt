# The PewPew Ecosystem
Published on 2022-05-27 in {ref}`project-185291`.

PewPew LCD is a very simple device: just a display and a
microcontroller. The real power for it comes from the whole [PewPew](https://pewpew.rtfd.io/)  ecosystem, that has been growing over the years witch each new
workshop.

There is a lot of documentation, starting with the [pew library reference](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pew.html) , through the basic  [bouncing ball tutorial](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) , to the more advanced [sokoban tutorial](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial-sokoban.html) .

There is documentation for [all the hardware devices](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devices.html) , and also [pewmulator](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pewmulator.html) , a program that lets you run PewPew games on your computer with
regular Python.

And for those who want to extend the PewPew devices, there is a whole [section on connecting various electronic components](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html)  to the expansion connector, and controlling them from code. This lets
you not only add additional effects to your games,  or use non-
standard ways of controlling them, but also lets you reuse the device
for your electronic projects, whether it's a plant monitoring system,
a smart home controller, or some kind of remote control for a robot.

Finally there is a [community](https://pewpew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community.html)  page, that links to the mailing list for the project, the
repositories with code and hardware designs, and the CircuitPython
Discord server, where you can get help.

Finally, in the repositories you can find all the games:


 *  [snake](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-snake) 
 *  [tetris](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-tetris) 
 *  [othello](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-othello) 
 *  [sokoban](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-sokoban) 
 *  [boulder](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-boulder) 
 *  [lightsout](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-lightsout) 
 *  [breakout](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-breakout) 
 *  [frog](https://github.com/pypewpew/game-frog) 

They can both give you inspiration and serve as starting points for
your own games.

Hopefully, with further workshops and with more people discovering the
joy of making simple games this ecosystem will continue to grow and
improve.

However, on the PewPew LCD you are not limited to just the PewPew
ecosystem! Because it comes with CircuitPython's displayio, you can
use the display for anything, not just 8x8 pixels for simple games.
And if you really want to, you could it even program it with Arduino
or any other environment available for SAMD21, to really leverage the
power of that  tiny microcontroller — there is, however, no ready
support for this, so you would be mostly on your own.\
