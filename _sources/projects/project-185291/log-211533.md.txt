# Swiss Python Summit 2022
Published on 2022-09-30 in {ref}`project-185291`.

I was speaking about the PewPew devices, among other things, at this
year's Swiss Python Summit, and there is now recording of my talk
available. I tried to do some live coding with the {ref}`project-80626` , but ran out of time very quickly. Oh well, I should have done it
with PewPew, it would be much quicker.
