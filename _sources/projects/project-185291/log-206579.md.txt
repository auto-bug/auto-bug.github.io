# Version 2.1 Assembled
Published on 2022-05-27 in {ref}`project-185291`.

The PCBs from [@ElecrowÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/879772) arrived today, so it's time to assemble the new version. There were
absolutely no surprised, and everything seems to be exactly as it
should be:

The display aligns with the silkscreen properly now, and the traces
for the buttons no longer get in the way of touching them, so there
are no misclicks.

On the back there is room for your name:

Unless I'm missing something very bad, this is the final version of
the device. Now it's just a question of the software for it.
