# More Battery
Published on 2022-05-28 in {ref}`project-185291`.

We have talked a little bit about the choice of batteries before in
terms of the use cases, practicality and environment. But what if you
need to this device to last longer than the two or three days you
would normally get, and don't want to have to swap the batteries?

Well, turns out that using a cutout in the PCB in place of a regular
battery holder has an unexpected advantage â€” it fits more kinds of
batteries! Instead of your regular CR2032 cell you can fit a fat
CR2450 cell in there, and it still works!
