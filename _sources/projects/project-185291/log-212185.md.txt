# PewPew Around the World
Published on 2022-10-13 in {ref}`project-185291`.

PewPew is not just the device. It's being used around the world.
People make PewPew-compatible devices, such as  [Christian Walther's PicoPew](https://twitter.com/isziaui/status/1420754882395443209) , they write new games for it, and even publish them online, such as [Łukasz and Stanley Langa's DDRez](https://twitter.com/llanga/status/1559249954262204417) , and most importantly, they run workshops with them, such as the most
recent  [Cheuk Ting Ho's workshop at PyCon Ghana.](https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho/status/1580614462478118912) 

I hope that now with this even cheaper and improved device it will
become even more useful for all kinds of educators, from self-taught
amateurs, through volunteers, to professional teachers. Of course the
most important thing for this to happen is documentation, so that's
what most focus will now be on going forward. The hardware seems good
enough for now, and the software can use some small improvements
still, but is basically usable, but you can never have enough
documentation.
