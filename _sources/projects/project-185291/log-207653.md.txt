# A Workshop
Published on 2022-06-19 in {ref}`project-185291`.

There have been no updates for a while, but that doesn't mean the
project is done. There is still a lot of documentation and other
materials to be written and I really need a better program for the
game selection menu. But it's not as easy work as physically building
something, so it takes longer. I'm hoping to do some of it as part of
preparations for workshops.

I'm going to be [running a workshop this year](https://ep2022.europython.eu/session/pew-pew-workshop)  at Europython in Dublin, using the PewPew badges from 2019 (sadly,
chip shortage doesn't allow us to use newer versions, but luckily
there were some badges left over in storage, so we can use that).
Apart from the workshop, there are also going to be tables for makers
available throughout the conference, and I'm sure I will be spending a
lot of time there, so if you are around and interested in PewPew, drop
in.

There are also going to be sprints at the end, and I hope we can get
some CircuitPython development done on them.
