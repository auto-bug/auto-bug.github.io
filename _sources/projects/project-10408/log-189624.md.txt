# Version Two
Published on 2021-02-23 in {ref}`project-10408`.

As you might have guessed from the previous log, I decided to try and
make another stenotype. This time with a little bit more experience
from my low-profile keyboard projects. Of course it's low-profile, and
of course it runs CircuitPython.

I used blue Kailh Choc switches, because they are very light, with 25g
springs. That is important, because you are usually pressing a lot of
keys at once, and the forces add up quickly. The switches are linear,
not clicky, but I think it's fine.

I used some keycaps I had left over from building other keyboards â€”
mostly function keys and some random stuff like Print Screen or
alternate Alt. I couldn't use keys with proper legends, because the
letters repeat here, so I would need several sets. Instead I bought
several sheets of stickers for "converting" your keyboard to a
different layout. They look bad, but it works well enough for
training.

Right now I programmed it as a keyboard to be used with Plover, but
ultimately I want to make it work like real stenotypes, as a serial
device. CircuitPython just recently had a se]cond USB CDC device
added, so I can use that.
