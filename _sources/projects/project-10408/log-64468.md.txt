# Back on the Ring
Published on 2017-08-01 in {ref}`project-10408`.

I found this keyboard today in my drawer, and decided to try and
revive it. The project got, um, paused indefinitely over a year ago,
when I stupidly got superglue inside the key switches, and pretty much
ruined them.

Today I decided to take a little bit of risk -- since the switches are
broken anyways the way they are -- and applied a little bit of acetone
to one of the keys. Lo and behold, it budged! A little bit of wiggling
and scraping and removing the gunk from it, and it works almost as
well as it used to. Great! Only 21 more to go!

Three hours later I pretty much have all the switches working (I had
to replace one of them, but fortunately I still had some spares), and
I am back to where the project was last time -- I have the rows of the
keys soldered, and now I need to solder a diode to each key and then
connect the columns, and connect everything to a Pro Micro.
