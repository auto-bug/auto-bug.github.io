# Keycaps
Published on 2016-04-06 in {ref}`project-10408`.

The blank keycaps I ordered finally arrived. I decided to use blanks,
because this keyboard layout is really non-standard, and it would be
difficult to get the right keys with the right letters on them,
especially since some of the letters repeat. I might figure out some
way of adding the letters on those keycaps later on, we will see.

The keycaps are low-profile, but the keyboard is still pretty high --
as is expected with a mechanical keyboard. Next I need to cut a bottom
plate for it, but that's after the conference.
