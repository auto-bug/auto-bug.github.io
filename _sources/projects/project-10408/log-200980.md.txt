This time, instead of my favorite SAMD21 I userd a standard Pro Micro
with Atmega32u4, and programmed it with QMK. This is to make this as
easy to reproduce as possible, because the goal is to have an
affordable steno machine with enough keys to do stenotyping in Polish.

The back has some nice foam stickers, so that it won't scratch the
desk:
