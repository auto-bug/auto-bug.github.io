# Stenotyping in Polish
Published on 2021-11-24 in {ref}`project-10408`.

Stenotyping somehow never caught up in Poland, and while there are
several systems of stenography, there is none for stenotypy. But that
just means there is an opportunity!

 [Krzysztof Smirnow](https://www.stenografia.pl/)  describes his quest to bring Polish to Plover, the open source
stenography engine. However, because Slavic languages tend to have a
lot of sounds, a regular stenotype, like the one I made, is not up to
the task. More keys are required.

So after a short exchange of e-mails, I sat down and tried to design a
PCB for a stenotype that would be suitable for Polish, and at the same
time not too expensive and easy to assemble at home. I came up with
this:

The idea is that, since you have to order multiple PCBs anyways, I can
save on the PCB size by only designing half of it, and then designing
the other half on the back side. Then you take two of the, join
together, solder a Pro Micro on top, add the diodes and switches, and
you are ready to go!

Unfortunately, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that even if
you make two of them at once (which saves you some money, because the
keycaps come in packs of 60, enough for two), they still cost about
$45. Sure, that's not the $3000 you would pay for a commercial
stenotype, but still more han you'd spend on something you try and
discard.

I'm still going to make one, just to see if I made any mistakes.
