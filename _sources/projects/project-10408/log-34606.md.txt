# Designing a Keyboard
Published on 2016-03-26 in {ref}`project-10408`.

I've been through building a keyboard {ref}`project-8282` , so this time I knew exactly what to do. First I went to [http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/)  and made a keyboard with the steno layout, which, for English at
least, looks like this:

Then I clicked on the "raw data" tab, and copied the keyboard
definition, which looks like this:
```json
[{a:7,h:2},"S","T","P","H",{h:2},"<i class='fa fa-asterisk'></i>","F","P","L","T","D"],
[{x:1},"K","W","R",{x:1},"R","B","G","S","Z"],
[{x:2.5},"A","O","E","U"

```

Then I went to [http://builder.swillkb.com/](http://builder.swillkb.com/)  and pasted that code in there. After selecting some options, it
generated me an SVG file that looks like this:

I opened that in Libre Office (Inkscape has problem with exporting
PDFs with very thin lines), changed the line width to 0.01mm, saved
that as PDF and went to the nearby FabLab to have it laser-cut. I
actually choose too weak laser power, so the cuts were not whole way
through, and then I moved it, so I couldn't repeat the cutting, but
nothing that can't be fixed with a bit of demeling. Final plate looks
like this:

I still have some Gateron Brown switches left from my previous
keyboard, so I will be using those. They just snap into those holes --
easy enough. Keycaps are a bigger problem -- as you can see, I will
need several with the same letter, and also for different rows than
normally. The keys on your keyboard usually have different height
depending on which row they are.So I went to [http://pimpmykeyboard.com/](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/)  and ordered myself some blank keycaps. I also picked the low-profile
ones, which are all the same height. This is actually the most
expensive part of this project. Now I'm waiting for the keycaps to
arrive.
