# Abort Mission
Published on 2016-04-15 in {ref}`project-10408`.

Last Monday I worked a little bit more on this keyboard. I decided to
start on the wiring. I did the rows, and then I decided the keys are
not sitting in their holes well enough. So I decided to do what I did
with my previous two keyboards -- glue the switches in place.

Unfortunately, this time I used instant glue, and applied it when the
keyboard was up-side-down, so that the glue got into the switches.
Sure enough, they are all glued hard, and there is no force that could
budge them now. I suppose I could try removing them, opening each and
cleaning, but they would never again work as well as before, and I
honestly don't have any stamina left to do it.

So I'm aborting this project, with a small possibility of reviving it
if I get my hands on some spare switches again.
