# My First PCB
Published on 2015-01-21 in {ref}`project-3736`.

Since I had the schematic in Fritzing already, I decided to use it for
a test of the printed circuit board etching process, which I wanted to
learn. So I made a simple design for it:

Then I printed it on a shiny calendar paper on my laser printer, and
transferred the toner with an iron. Initially I made a mistake and
printed it like it was, while I should have printed a mirrored
version:

But I quickly re-did the whole thing. Then the acid bath, and cutting
the margins, and voila, the finished PCB:

I still need to drill the holes, but I don't have the drill bit for
the 0.5mm holes -- waiting for it to ship in a day or two.
