# RIP ESP-12
Published on 2015-06-05 in {ref}`project-3736`.

I have a lot of bad luck with this project. Or maybe I'm just sloppy.
Anyways, I uploaded the nodemcu firmware, uploaded the uBob code, and
decided it's time to test the servos -- to do that, I need to run it
from a battery. So I got out my battery, and tried to connect it, but
the connector wouldn't want to fit... So I forced it. And when I saw
the blue smoke, I realized I connected it backwards...

The module fried, along with the power switch. Probably also the
distance sensor.

I quickly desoldered the fried module and switch, and soldered new
ones (ugh, my stash is running out). Uploaded firmware, uploaded code,
connected battery, connected servos, ran it:

It works! Of course I switched two of the pins, but that's a small
correction in the software. But does the distance sensor work? A quick
test says "no". It always returns 1. And I don't know if it's a bad
connection, bad wiring, or if I fried it too. I also don't have enough
motivation now to desolder everything and solder a new sensor, so I'm
putting it off to some later date. Maybe by that time I can use
Micropython!
