# Not Feeling Well
Published on 2015-04-17 in {ref}`project-3736`.

So I was presenting my robots on this year's PyCon.us, and this little
guy didn't survive the flight over the Big Pond. It looks like the
ESP8266 board is fried. When I get home, I will rebuild it properly,
on a printed circuit board and with some nice distance sensors, and,
most importantly, a voltage regulator.
