# The Body
Published on 2016-12-30 in {ref}`project-3736`.

Today I'm continuing the work on resurrecting ÂµBob. I decided to use a
Pololu SHARP distance sensor (because it can work with 3V), and using
a bit of hot glue I attached the pins to it, so that I can plug it in
easily:

On the robot side, I used stacking headers to give some distance from
the PCB:

Next, to make sure it will walk in this configuration, a quick test:

Then I worked on the body frame. I decided to use paperclips this
time. Turns out you can solder them, so I bent them and soldered them
into the holes in the PCB:

A little bit of hot glue, and the hat is back on:

Finally, I also transplanted the old mustache.
