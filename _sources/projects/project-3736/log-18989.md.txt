# PCB Fun
Published on 2015-06-04 in {ref}`project-3736`.

The PCB I made for ÂµBob last time didn't work out so well, so I set
out to make another one. This time with the ESP-12 module, as the
ESP-03 I used before got broken in transport (I soldered some parts,
including the power switch, directly to the module, and when there was
some force applied on them during transport, they stripped the traces
on the module).

I also got inspired by the [Bob jr. robot](http://letsmakerobots.com/blog/yahmez/bob-jr-updated)  and decided to make it a proper autonomous robot -- with a distance
sensor! I'm going to use one of those teeny little digital Sharp
sensors, this one should detect stuff between 2 and 10cm, which sounds
about right for this size of a robot.

So I have my PCB designed, and now I'm struggling with transferring
the toner from a print onto the board. The latest attempt is almost
acceptable, if not for several places where the toner didn't transfer
for some reason:
