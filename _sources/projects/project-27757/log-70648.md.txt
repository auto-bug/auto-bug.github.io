# Shield Connectors
Published on 2017-11-18 in {ref}`project-27757`.

One of the main challenges when making an accessory for the micro:bit
is connecting it to the device. The large holes might be convenient
for alligator clips, but not for pretty much anything else, and the
edge connector is huge and hard to design a PCB for. This time, since
I only need two pins for I2C and one for the speaker, I decided to go
with bolts. However, I don't have room on the front side of the board
for bolt holes (the display and buttons are too wide), so I need them
in a "surface mount" version. Turns out that some large pads with
vias, together with solder paste and a generous application of the hot
air gun work pretty well for that:

I even found some brass bolts without heads dedicated to be soldered
to a PCB, but it will be a while before those arrive, so in the mean
time I'm testing with regular bolts.
