I didn't manage to get that display to work, even though the circuit
is copied directly from the datasheet.  Interestingly, the modules
with this display that I have use completely different values for all
the components than the datasheet says — I tried with those too, to no
avail. So I decided to take a step back and do it the easier way.

There is a very small, minimalist module with this display designed as
a shield for one of the new ESP32 boards, that will work just fine for
my purposes. It already has all the needed components and it's
working, so I will just use that. In addition, because now I have the
display on a separate PCB, I can stack that PCB over the bolts, so I
can use regular holes for the bolts, and change the orientation of the
whole device, so that the A and B buttons of the micro:bit can also be
used as shoulder buttons.

The PCB looks like this:

I also decided to use an ATtiny24 for handling the buttons — this way
I can write the latching code exactly the way I want it, and also do
debouncing and all that internally. I briefly considering just using
the analog pin and a bunch of resistors for the buttons, but I don't
trust those bolt connections.
