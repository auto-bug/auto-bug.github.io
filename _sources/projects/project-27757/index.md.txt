    The Micro:bit is a pretty decent platform for teaching kids to
program, but you can't really make arcade-style games for it. You only
have two buttons and a 5x5 display. Perhaps enough for a very small
snake game, but that's pretty much it. That's why I started working on {ref}`project-21578` as an alternative platform, but at some point I started wondering if
it's really impossible to do it on the micro:bit.

When the most recent version of micropython got the ability to use any
pins for I2C, I realized that I can finally connect a display easily.
I could use a HT16K33 and a 8x8 LED matrix like on the PewPew, but I
decided to try something else â€” a monochrome OLED display, similar to
the one used on many Arduino-based game consoles.
