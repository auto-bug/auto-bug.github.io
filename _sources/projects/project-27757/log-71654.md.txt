# After All it Works!
Published on 2017-12-17 in {ref}`project-27757`.

I have re-read what I wrote in my previous log, and got that "wait a
minute" moment. I'm using a circuit literally copied from the
datasheet. All connections are correct.  There is I2C communication.
It just doesn't display anything. Perhaps it's the display that is
broken? So I tried with another display, and lo and behold! It works!

To be honest, I don't think the display arrived broken — I think I
broke it with my initial tries, when the components were taken from
the SSD1306 datasheet, instead of the SH1106.

But if the display works, that means I can assemble the whole thing
and start programming for it! I quickly added all the remaining
components, programmed the micro:bit with the "fill the display with
random dots" demo, and it works:

I even added the function to read the button states:


```python
def buttons():
    microbit.i2c.write(0x70, b'\x40', repeat=True)
    buttons = microbit.i2c.read(0x70, 2)
    return buttons[0] >> 7 | buttons[1] << 1
```

And I have all that is needed for simple games. For more complex
games, I still need to implement the "blit" method — or three, for
and, or, and xor. 

I'm still fine with the redesign I described in the previous log,
though — this layout has one large problem: the micro:bit connectors
are right under your fingers, including the i2c signals — and when you
touch them, you get communication errors with the display. Switching
to horizontal layout not only moves the connections out of the reach,
but also makes it easy to use the two buttons on the back, so  think
it's better, even though the direction buttons are a little bit more
squashed.
