# 2.0 Already!
Published on 2022-12-31 in {ref}`project-188909`.

I looked at my PCB design today with fresh eyes, and I found a mistake
in how the power is routed, which would require a bodge. So I used
that as an excuse to re-design it with the 14250 battery holder, which
also made it much smaller. And since you can add designs to an
existing order in JLCPCB, I did just that. So the 1.0 version will be
obsolete on arrival, sadly, but I will get to build a much smaller
robot.

I also went ahead and designed a PCB for the mechanical parts of the
legs. I was lucky to not get hit by the panelization penalization, but
it's fine for a one-off design like this. If I were making more units,
I would go for laser-cut parts instead.
