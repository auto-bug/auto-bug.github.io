# Now Just Program It
Published on 2023-01-26 in {ref}`project-188909`.

The last part that was missing - the battery - arrived yesterday, so I
was able to verify that everything works so far. Unfortunately, the
servos come from two different batches, and some of them rotate in
opposite directions. I could fix that in hardware by just opening them
and swapping the leads to the motors, but I think that I will instead
make the code a little bit more flexible, add a Servo class and allow
inverting each of the servos individually. It's also possible I got
some of the pin numbers swapped around â€“ I need some quiet
experimenting time to figure it all out, and also to fine-tune the
trims on the servos and so on.
