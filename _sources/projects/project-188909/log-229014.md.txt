# Designs Published
Published on 2024-04-16 in {ref}`project-188909`.

I have been putting off publishing the design files and code, hoping
that I can clean them up a little bit first, but who am I kidding? If
I don't publish them as they are, they are probably never going to be
public. So I put them on github, you can find the link to the project
repository on the left side of the hackaday.io project page.

I will keep adding to the documentation, right now it's just the PCB
schematic and designs, and the basic walking code. That should be
enough for experienced tinkerers, but it could be much better, and I
hope to make it better over time.
