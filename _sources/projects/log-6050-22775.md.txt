# Licenses
Published on 2015-08-14 in {ref}`project-6050`.

To be eligible for the Hackaday Prize, I have to explicitly document
the licenses for everything. So here it goes.

designs, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-
NonCommercial 4.0 International License. See [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)  for details.
 * The Arduino libraries which I depend upon are licensed under the LGPL
license.
