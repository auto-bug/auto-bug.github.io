# Why?
Published on 2018-07-17 in {ref}`project-159787`.

Every time I looked at a development board that had USB A plug
integrated into its PCB, I saw the teeth of a skull. So one night when
I couldn't sleep, I fired up Inkscape, drew a rectangle and three
ellipses, and made this.

Once I had it imported into Fritzing, I had to decide what components
to put on it. I could simply make it an USB light, with two LEDs in
the eyes. Or I could make it play a melody, like the {ref}`project-7860` . In the end, I decided to just put a SAMD21 chip on it, and make it
equivalent to an Adafruit Gema M0.

 [You can get the boards](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/xNvQYFxd)  at [@oshparkÂ ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) if you want to make your own. It only has four components, but one of
them is a QFN package, so a hot air gun is recommended.

Once the PCBs arrive, I will make a board definition for CircuitPython
for it.
