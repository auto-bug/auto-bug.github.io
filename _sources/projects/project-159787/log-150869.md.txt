# Jolly Wrencher Done
Published on 2018-08-12 in {ref}`project-159787`.

The PCBs arrived from [@oshpark ](https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216) (thank you again for all the help!) and the Jolly Wrencher USB key is
assembled:

As the previous board, it just runs CircuitPython, with some tiny USB
mass storage for the scripts, and a serial console with the Python
REPL. I imagine it could be useful for testing various sensors and
displays and such — the pins I have broken out support I2C and SPI,
they also all have ADC and one even has a DAC. One pin is also
internally connected to the copper pour, to detect touches. But there
are 20 unused GPIO pins there, and I wonder if I should add some
blinky LEDs or something in there... but then the board would look
much busier. I'm torn between simplicity and optimization.
