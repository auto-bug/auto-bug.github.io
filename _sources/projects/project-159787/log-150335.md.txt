# Jolly Wrencher Redoux
Published on 2018-08-02 in {ref}`project-159787`.

I didn't particularly like how the Jolly Wrencher from the previous
log came out, so I played with it a little bit more and shrunk it
somewhat.

I removed the two pads from the eyes, because they made it look
scared. I also rearranged them so that you have at least one i2c/spi
peripheral on the pads.
