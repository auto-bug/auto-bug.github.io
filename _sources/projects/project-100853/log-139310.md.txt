# The Look-up Table Holds the Secret
Published on 2018-04-05 in {ref}`project-100853`.

I spent half of the last night poring over the datasheets and wading
through horrible C code examples, but finally I managed to find the
code that was used to make this example:


<iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="None" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJuNz2a9qcQ"></iframe>

Inside I found a lot of scrambled code, unused files, copy-pasted
fragments, but also the thing I was looking for: the LUT tables for
the refresh sequence! After adding them to my driver code, the full
refresh suddenly takes less than 2 seconds, and the "quick" refresh is
practically instant (but of course leaves some mess from the previous
image). That is so much better!

I have published my driver code here:Â  [https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/circuitpython-epaper/src/](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/circuitpython-epaper/src/)
