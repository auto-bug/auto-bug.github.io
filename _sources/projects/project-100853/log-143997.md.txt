# Mockup
Published on 2018-04-14 in {ref}`project-100853`.

Since the contest requires it, and since I finally know what shape
this badge is going to have, here's a little mockup image, at 1:1
scale, with some of the parts placed next to it to give a better idea
of how it's going to look like.

I'm considering making it so that you can break off the bottom part
and wear it as a badge alone, and use the electronic part of the badge
separately. The battery holder is too big, because it's a 4 AAA one,
not 3 AAA â€” I didn't have the correct size at hand.
