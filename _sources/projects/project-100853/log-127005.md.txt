# Not Again!
Published on 2018-03-23 in {ref}`project-100853`.

Recently a bunch of people on the hack chat (including me) decided to
start a {ref}`project-92210` project. That led me to order a couple of interesting display modules,
and when they arrived, I started to have ideas for projects using
them. One module that interested me in particular is based on the  [UC1701](https://github.com/deshipu/displays/wiki/UC1701)  controller chip, and sports a nice ~1.5" LCD display, with optional
backlight. The display only requires two capacitors and a resistor for
the LED, so it should be easy to use in my own project.

At first I thought about using it to replace {ref}`project-26823` 's display, but since it has the backlight built-in, I would need to
also remove lameboy's color backlight, and that would make me sad. So
instead I decided to build yet another device.

I have also been recently asked in a non-committal manner about some
conference badges that would run (Micro)Python. From the conversation
I learned that people really don't want to have LiPo batteries on them
— which pretty much rules out using ESP8266 or ESP32 chips, as they
are pretty power-hungry. The next cheapest chip you can get that has a
flavor of MicroPython ported to it is the SAMD21, and that also only
needs two capacitors and a voltage regulator.

So, throw six buttons, a switch, a USB connector and a battery holder
into the mix, and you have a minimal handheld game console. I quickly
made a PCB design in Fritzing to see how feasible it is:

And it's not bad at all. It even fits in the 50×50mm limit. All
components are on one side, except for the battery holder. I got rid
of the diode protecting the USB from battery by using the switch —
instead of on/off, it switches between battery and USB power. To save
power, the backlight is only on when on USB power. There is no extra
flash memory for the files — a 32kB filesystem is created in the
chip's internal flash instead. Since the 128×64 black-and-white
display doesn't need much memory for graphics, this should work. There
are six free pins (actually there are more, but they were too hard to
route) broken out on the header at the top, so you can connect
additional things, like a speaker or an IR sensor.

I also added a large pad on the back to which you can solder a pin or
a clip  — so that you can actually wear this as a badge.
