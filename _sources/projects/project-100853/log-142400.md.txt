# Mark II
Published on 2018-04-10 in {ref}`project-100853`.

After realizing that that LCD display is way too slow for games, I
quickly designed a version with an OLED display, re-using the designs
and the parts from the {ref}`project-27757` project — I didn't get the display to work there, but now that I knew
about the reset requirements, I was confident it will work. Surprise!
It doesn't. I now suspect that the whole batch of displays I got might
be faulty, or simply using a different chip than advertised. In any
case, here are some photos of the assembled device:

Note how few components are required!

I decided to not pursue that direction much, and instead focus on the
e-ink display. Right now I'm exploring the different possible shapes
the badge could have — more about it in a separate log.
