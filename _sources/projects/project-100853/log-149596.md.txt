# Testing Prototypes and Possible Optimizations
Published on 2018-07-16 in {ref}`project-100853`.

I have five prototypes assembled and tested, and I'm going to take
them next week to Europython to Edinburgh and pass them on for
testing. We decided to skip this year and I'm for next year, which
will give us more time to develop the libraries and examples for them.

In the mean time, as I'm working on the {ref}`project-159733` , I'm getting ideas about how to reduce the parts count and price of
those badges. Since I'm using two 7×11 matrices, I can drive them with
just 18 pins by using a kind of charlieplexing approach — that means
that a bigger SAMD21 chip should be able drive them all, and still
have spare pins for breaking out. That could shave off as much as ¼ of
the cost. Of course the cost of that would be scanning the matrix in
software, but I already have to write the library for this for the
PewPew.

I also still need to get the radio going. There are ready NRF24
libraries, but I think we will want to have something custom more
similar to Micro:bit's "radio" library.
