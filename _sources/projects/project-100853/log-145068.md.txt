# PCBs on the Way
Published on 2018-04-23 in {ref}`project-100853`.

It's the first time I'm ordering the PCBs at [jlcpcb.com](http://jlcpcb.com) , so I'm not entirely sure how this will go. Looking at the order
status page, they have already shipped them, so I hope to have them
here in a couple of days.

In the mean time, I found a mistake — of course! The SDB pin on the
IS31FL3733 should be pulled up, while I am pulling it down. This is a
third time I'm making this mistake, because on the schematic on the
datasheet that pin is pulled down and connected to a microcontroller
pin, so that the chip is disabled by default and can be enabled on
demand. But in this case I want the chip to be always on, and I don't
want to waste a pin for this. Fortunately, I can simply solder the
resistor only by one of its pads, and use bodge wire to connect it to
a nearby via.

I am also considering upping the display resolution to luxurious 16×16
by using an IS31FL3741 and four 8x8 matrices. That would of course
require a redesign, and I don't have any IS31FL3741 at hand, so we
will see. The 14×11 I have right now should be good enough, and four
matrices instead of two would push the price a bit.
