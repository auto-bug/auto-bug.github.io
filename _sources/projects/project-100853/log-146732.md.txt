# Full PCB
Published on 2018-05-25 in {ref}`project-100853`.

Of course the PCBs arrived just as I'm leaving for the Belgrade
conference, so no chance to assemble one and use there as a badge. Oh
well, I think I will wear an unpopulated PCB anyways.

As I was afraid, the large white area of the silkscreen doesn't look
too great. I think that I will use a white PCB and just a black
outline next time.
