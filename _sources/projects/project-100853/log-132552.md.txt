# Is E-ink Ready Yet?
Published on 2018-03-27 in {ref}`project-100853`.

Of course the obvious solution for a display for a conference badge is
e-paper or e-ink display. It has a number of advantages:


 * keeps displaying with the device off, which means that you could even
do without the battery, or — if you really want to have interactive
elements there — have the microcontroller sleep most of the time,
 * high contrast, readable from a distance,
 * low resolution and color count — which means low RAM requirements,
 * relatively new and very cool technology,
 * physically robust (at least more so than glass displays) and safe when
broken (no sharp edges),

It also has a couple of drawbacks:


 * slow to update — even more so than the LCDs, partial updates help
somewhat,
 * expensive, at least until recently,
 * requires additional components for the high-voltage driving — but any
larger OLED has the same problem,
 * no ready libraries — but I would write my own libraries for the
display anyways,
 * risky, requires research,
 * no idea how easy to source it is in larger quantities.

But all in all, it is certainly an interesting option to explore. So I
went to my favorite Chinese shopping website, and had a look around.
Sure enough, most of those displays cost around 4x more than I would
like the whole device to cost, but there are some interesting options.
In particular, the GDEW0154T8 display can be bought for less than $5,
even cheaper in larger quantities. But is there any documentation for
it? Yes!

A bit of googling, and we can find [this page](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/E-ink-E-paper-Display) , with links to [the datasheet for the display](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/image/data/9_Modules/EinkDisplay/GDEW0154T8/GDEW0154T8.zip)  and for [the driving chip](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/image/data/9_Modules/EinkDisplay/GDEW0154T8/IL0373.pdf) .

Looking at the datasheet, it doesn't look bad. Resolution 152×152,
1-bit color, 6s refresh time — sure, not too great, but for that price
what can you expect. More importantly, there is a typical application
circuit example there, and it only has 11 capacitors, 3 Schottky
diodes, a resistor, a mosfet and an inductor. There is also a
temperature sensor, but looking at the breakout boards, it seems to be
optional.

I could live with that. More details when the breakouts and displays
arrive.\
