# Full Badge Assembled and Working
Published on 2018-05-31 in {ref}`project-100853`.

I finally had some time to sit down and assemble the badge. The
accelerometer chips still didn't arrive, but I just desoldered one
from some breakout board I found in my drawer. As usual, the QFN
matrix controller chip didn't get soldered properly, and I had to
desolder the matrices, fix the chip, and re-solder them back. Some
traces got pulled in the process, but fortunately for unused pins of
the matrices, so it's fine.

Of course my camera can't handle the brightness of the LEDs, so
instead of red they appear yellow.
