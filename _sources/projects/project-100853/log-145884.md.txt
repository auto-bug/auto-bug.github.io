# Repository and Schematic
Published on 2018-05-06 in {ref}`project-100853`.

I spent some time cleaning up the schematic — fixing the custom part
graphics, adding net labels and arranging it in a way that hopefully
makes it a bit easier to read. In the proces I noticed that I didn't
connect the ground of the buttons on the right side to the ground —
another bodge wire needed. Also, all the values for resistors and
capacitors are still wrong — I will need to change them.

I also put all the design files and code into a [repository](https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/circuitpython-badge) , for everybody to enjoy. Please be aware that it is still work in
progress and that there most likely will be changes.\
