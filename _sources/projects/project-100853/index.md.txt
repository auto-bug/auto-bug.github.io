    More and more conferences want to have a cool badge. But most badges
are not really that interesting or useful. Sure, you can learn
soldering if you have to assemble it yourself — but then most people
never do. You can play tetris during boring talks, or, if you really
don't want to attend any talks, you can spend time programming it in
some exotic assembly to play snake. And as soon as you get home, it
goes into a drawer to never see the light of day again.

But we can do better than that!

We can make a badge that is useful during the conference — that has
USB disk storage where you can put conference materials, slides of all
talks, etc. It can display the schedule, and maybe even have reminders
for the talks you wanted to see. It can have some simple games for the
boring talks, but also perhaps some social games, to make you talk to
other people. But most importantly of all, it can be super-easy to
program, without having to install anything on your computer or learn
some esoteric language — by simply copying Python files on it. And
finally, when you get home from the conference, you can incorporate it
into other projects.

This project is not about a badge for any particular conference. It's
about making a baseline project, that can be then taken and
extended/modified for a particular conference. The idea is that it
should be easier to make something actually useful, instead of a
gadget with blinking LEDs.
