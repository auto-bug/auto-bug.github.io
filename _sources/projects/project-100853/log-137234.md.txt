Whatever display I end up using, I'm going to need to display text on
it. So I went to work on that. I drew a 6×8 font, which gives me 21
columns and 8 rows on the 128×64 display:

I went with bold characters, because I want good readability, and I
used height of 8 pixels, because that's the display's page height, and
it makes it super-easy to draw the characters. Since I only use the
128 ASCII characters (minus the 32 control characters, actually), I
used the highest bit to reverse the text — that will be useful for
cursors/menus.

I still need to figure out double-width and double-size characters
somehow (if it's a badge, it'd better show your name in a font
readable from afar).
