# Prototypes in Good Hands
Published on 2018-10-01 in {ref}`project-100853`.

It took some logistic trickery, but we got five prototypes of the
badge into hands of willing and skilled people, who will now test and
improve the hardware, software and documentation. There is a
repository at  [https://github.com/circuitpython-badge/circuitpython-badge](https://github.com/circuitpython-badge/circuitpython-badge)  containing what was produced during the sprints at [PyCon.UK](http://PyCon.UK) , and some discussions in the issues section. After the initial
prototype design we can now hopefully take it to the next step, to
make it fit the needs of the conference participants.
