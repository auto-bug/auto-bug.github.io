I finally had some time to program a simple behavior using the new
distance sensor. The robot follows whatever is in front of it, trying
to keep a constant distance. When the object disappears, it stops and
looks around for it. See the video:

One thing that made it a little challenging is that the output from
this sensor is very noisy. I worked around that by keeping the last 10
measurements in a queue, and using the average of them -- a kind of a
low-pass filter.
