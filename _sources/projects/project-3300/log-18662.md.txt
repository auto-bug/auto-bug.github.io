# Sensing the Servo Position
Published on 2015-05-29 in {ref}`project-3300`.

So I finally came around to testing this setup. A 9g hobby servo, with
an additional cable hooked up to the middle pin of its pot, and
connected to an analog pin on the arduino. Voila, now we can sense the
position of the servo. Kinda.

Turns out that even with a lot of small capacitors all over the place,
and software smoothing of the signal, I still can't get more precise
than about 2Â°. Which is actually quite nice already if the only thing
you need is to tell if your servo "got there" already.

But I wanted much more. In particular, I wanted to be able to tell the
magnitude and direction of the force working against the servo. Then I
would be able to tell if the leg is supporting the robot's weight at
the moment (and hence wasn't put in the abyss beyond the table), or
even implement compliant motion, like in this video:

Alas, turns out that it's not so simple. The pot measures the servo's
position quite well when it's unloaded. but as soon as you put any
load on the servo, the reading is going up -- and that's no matter in
what direction you apply the load. That's not so good, and I think it
may have somethig to do with voltage drop on a loaded servo. I will
need more experiments.
