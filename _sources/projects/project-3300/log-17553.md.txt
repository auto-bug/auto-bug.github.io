# Tote, µKubik's younger brother
Published on 2015-05-08 in {ref}`project-3300`.

I separated the Arduino-only version of µKubik as a separate project,
called Tote, with comprehensive build instructions available at [http://tote.readthedocs.org/](http://tote.readthedocs.org/) 

It's supposed to be a starting point for people experimenting with
their own quadrupeds.
