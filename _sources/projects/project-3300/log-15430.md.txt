# Younger Brother
Published on 2015-03-19 in {ref}`project-3300`.

The PCBs just came from [DirtyPCBs](http://dirtypcbs.com/) , and I had the servos waiting since some time already, so I made a
brother of the µKubik. It uses pretty much the same cirtcuit as the
pKubik, my other project, but uses the much cheaper, but bigger, SG90
servos. I also added a socket for a cheap ultrasonic distance sensor
(much cheaper than the IR one used in µKubik). The software is exactly
the same as for pKubik (I didn't even tweak the leg dimensions in the
code, although I should).

The result is a budget version of the µKubik, with all the parts
together at about $25.

It's a nice starting point for building walking robots. The serial and
I²C interfaces of the Arduino are free, so you can use them to
communicate with anything you want to add to the robot -- whether it's
a more powerful processor, additional sensors or a laser gun. The
software is also very simple and leaves a lot of room for
experimenting and improvement. And you don't need any custom parts,
except for the PCB -- the legs use the servo horns and screws that are
shipped together with the servos.

I will keep on working on better assembly instructions and maybe an
improved PCB design (the current one has some tight spots, where order
of soldering is important). Maybe I will manage to somehow organize
some kind of a workshop, or even a contest for building them. We need
more walking robots everywhere!
