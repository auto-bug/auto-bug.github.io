# Sensing the Servo Force
Published on 2015-05-29 in {ref}`project-3300`.

So, a little bit of rethinking what I actually need, and the solution
became obvious. I don't want to know the position of the servo, I want
to know the force that is affecting it (and, at the same time, the
force that the servo is using to counter that). So, it doesn't make
sense to add the additional wire to the pot. I want to know how hard
the motor is working -- so the additional wire should go to one of the
motor pins. From that a couple of simple experiments, and I have my
"compliant motion", more or less:

Of course, the code is very crude, so it's easy to get oscillation or
runaway, but in the end I will use it for robot's sense, so it will
not feed itself...
