    <title>Switches and Keycaps</title>
    <updated>2015-12-17T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;The Gateron switches and the keycaps that I ordered on Massdrop
finally arrived. The switches fit nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-8282/images/4760751450349631799.jpg" src="projects/project-8282/images/4760751450349631799.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the with the keycaps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-8282/images/382361450349672885.jpg" src="projects/project-8282/images/382361450349672885.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have two problems to solve, though. First, while the switches
fit, they are not particularry well kept in place by their snaps,
which apparently are designed for a thinner board. I will need to hold
them in place with something. Second, the acrylic sheet on which they
sit is really flimsy. I will either need to find something more
robust, or have them touch the back plate for stability. We will see
how it develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fixed the switches in place with a little bit of glue (they can
still be removed if needed), and I soldered the horizontal connections
with a thick copper wire. Then I drilled the mounting holes for the A*
board, and secured it in place with screws. I also drilled the hole
for the USB cable, cut the plug from it, passed it through the hole
and re-soldered a “naked” plug back. The board is mounted above the
arrow keys in such a way, that you can see the LEDs on it – I will
use those for CapsLock and so on. Finally, I taped the metal back-
plate with some transparent tape, so that there are no shorts, and
screwed it to the back – to make sure everything fits properly. The
keyboard got much sturdier now, and I think it won’t need additional
enforcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-8282/images/6342241450545005077.jpg" src="projects/project-8282/images/6342241450545005077.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step is soldering the SMD diodes and the vertical columns, then
connecting it all to the board, and modifying the firmware for this
particular layout. It’s almost finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>PyBoard</title>
    <updated>2015-12-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="pyboard"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a version of Tote using PyBoard as its brains: &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-6877&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the code for that was translated from Tote’s Arduino code, and
didn’t work too well for some reason. I promised to try and fix that
some time ago, but somehow I never got the time for it. Last night I
finally got myself to remove the PyBoard from &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-3694&lt;/span&gt; , put it on Tote and program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the base, I used the micro:bit version of Tote’s code, since it’s
MicroPython too. I just added the servo-handling code that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/38882"&gt;&amp;#64;wagner&lt;/a&gt;  wrote for his robot. I also used the same pins, timers and channels.
Since I didn’t want to make a custom PCB, I just used the old trick
and connected the PyBoard using dupont cables:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6050/images/8629801450613484223.jpg" src="projects/project-6050/images/8629801450613484223.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting code is available at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/pyb_tote/src"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/pyb_tote/src&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reversing a Servo</title>
    <updated>2015-12-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="reversing-a-servo"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2015-12-20 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../projects/project-7168/#project-7168"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Logicoma-kun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long time since I worked on this robot, mainly because I
got stuck with the hands mechanism. You see, I want it to have hands
like the original Logikoma had, and since I have one free servo
channel, I wanted them to move, allowing me to grab things with them.
This gets rather difficult to do if you don’t want to make custom
3D-printed or laser-cut parts, and I didn’t think about it when I was
ordering the laser-cut chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally had this idea – I can just mount the hands directly on two
servos, and connect both servos to the same signal – pretty much what
I already do with the wheels. But then there is a tiny complication –
I need the servos to move in opposite directions. There is really no
room to mount one of them up-side down, so I still had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it occured to me. If you open a servo, you will see the PCB with
the electronics, and some leads going to the motor and to the
potentiometer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-7168/images/1183381450627741840.jpg" src="projects/project-7168/images/1183381450627741840.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swapping just the motor leads won’t work – the servo will go crazy
and try to move in the opposite direction than it wants. But if you
also swap the potentiometer leads, then all is good again – both the
motor direction and the position feedback are reversed. Voila, a
reversed servo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all I need is to attach them under Logicoma-kun’s body, and
connect to the one servo channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-7168/images/1751101450627898408.jpg" src="projects/project-7168/images/1751101450627898408.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then attach the hands to them, and we are done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Connections and Software</title>
    <updated>2015-12-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="connections-and-software"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2015-12-22 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-8282&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I finished the second version of Alpen Clack – this one
built from scratch. As always, the most work-intensive part was
soldering everything together. This time I used non-insulated wire,
and added some kapton tape where it might touch anything – this was
much faster than removing the insulation from wires for soldering. The
finished connections, before closing the keyboard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-8282/images/8888401450821121594.jpg" src="projects/project-8282/images/8888401450821121594.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next comes the programming. I used the same firmware as for version
one, except this time I had 6 columns and 17 rows (I kept the layout
rotated 90°, as this is much easier to fit in 80 columns of source
code). I also drilled a small hole for the reset button, to be able to
press it with a pin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining the layout was much easier this time, because of the saner
matrix – the Pololu A* Mini has enough pins broken out for me to not
care so much about saving them. Still, I miscalculated a little bit
and had to use one of the LED pins. That still left me two LEDs for
CapsLock and ScrollLock (no NumLock), so it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once everything was ready, I spent the customary 4 hours tearing my
hair off and staring at the code, trying to debug a problem with it.
In the end, it turned out that the compiler was caching a little more
than it should, and recompiling everything from scratch solved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
