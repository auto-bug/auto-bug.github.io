&lt;p&gt;Where are my robots? It’s already 15 years into the twenty-first
century, and we still don’t have robots everywhere. Sure, there are
some simple vacuum cleaners and some robo-pets for the ultimate geeks,
but that is not enough! Especially since the vacuum cleaners don’t
even walk. We need more walking robots everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that one of the reasons why we don’t have robots creeping and
crawling all around us is that researching walking robots is a time-
consuming, hard, and very expensive activity, traditionally confined
to the secret military laboratories. You need a big room with a crane
to hang your robot on, in case it falls, you need lots of hydraulic
actuators and a pump to power them, you need sophisticated sensors and
complex algorithms crunched on powerful computers, etc. At least
that’s how it has been so far. Even building a simple hexapod from a
kit, which, is not much more than a simple toy, can set you back
hundreds of dollars. No wonder we make no progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has to change. If we put a walking robot on the desk of every
high school student out there, and let them try hack on them and try
the craziest ideas, sooner or later someone will come up with a bunch
of cool tricks that let you solve that leg trajectory optimization
problem on an Arduino at 50Hz a second, instead of a supercomputer
crunching on a single frame whole day. We have a lot of corners we can
cut there. Plus, those same high school students are likely going to
continue their experiments and research and graduate in robotics and
build us that robot butler that we always wanted. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s my plan with Tote. To solve the humanity’s burning problem
of glaring lack of robots, I’m working on a robot that is suitable as
a base for experimenting with robot gaits and related problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="logs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="postlist-style-none postlist"&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2018-06-07 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-147636/"&gt;Reviving the Skull Tote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I have a number of prototypes of Tote that I have built over the
years, but the most presentable one is the one I pimped up in  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote/log/48853-pimp-your-bot"&gt;https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote/log/48853-pimp-your-bot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2017-01-15 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-51940/"&gt;Gangsta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;As I wrote in the previous logs, I’m going to be upgrading Tote to use
some more expensive, but more powerful and easier to use components.
But what about the poor students? If you are really concerned about
the budget, the original Tote is almost what you need. Almost, because
you would still need to order the PCB for it. Or would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2017-01-14 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-51852/"&gt;Programming the Spinal Cord&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;n the previous log I made a decision to use an Adafruit Feather board
for the robot’s brains, and a bare ATmega chip in a DIP package for
its spinal cord – that is, the servo controller. That’s supposed to
make the board much easier to solder even by inexperienced builders.
But wait a minute! How are they going to get the servo controller
program onto those chips? Will that not require some extra hardware?
Sadly, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2017-01-11 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-51725/"&gt;New Year Reflections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;This is one of my oldest projects, and definitely one that I have put
the most total work into so far. With the year’s end, I decided to
reflect a bit about the progress made so far and the way forward.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2017-01-11 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-51738/"&gt;Choosing the Brains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;In the previous post I shared some of my thoughts about this project,
and decided to pick a different development board than the Pro Mini
that I have been using so far. Don’t get me wrong, Pro Mini is great
for all kinds of small and cheap projects, it’s just that I want to
make programming this robot as simple as possible. That, among other
things, means using a platform that has a lot of computing power, not
just enough, preferably one that has so much of it, that it can be
used with a high-level language like Python. That also means something
that has a USB socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-12-22 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-50708/"&gt;imath.h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;It took me two evenings of pretty much randomly editing code, trying
to make it as small as possible without breaking it horribly at the
same time, but I finally have a library with three basic functions,&lt;em&gt;iasin&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;iatan2&lt;/em&gt; and_isqrt_, which are_int16_t_ versions of the ones from the standard library. The angles are
returned in the range of -1800 to 1800, and the input to asin is
-1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;13 +1 to 1&amp;lt;&amp;lt;13. The whole library is around 700 bytes (644 at the
last compile) and should be relatively fast on the AVR (although I
didn’t really time it). Oh, and the code is at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/imath/src/tip/imath.c"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/imath/src/tip/imath.c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-12-21 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-50664/"&gt;CORDIC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Since the flu season began, I’ve been lying in bed sick quite some
time. While I don’t recommend doing coding with a fever (takes way too
much time to track down the trivial mistakes you make), you do have
some free time to explore some coding ideas that you didn’t bother
with before. One of such things on my to do list is rewriting Tote’s
inverse kinematics code to use only integer math, and I found a
marvelous family of algorithms that can let me do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-12-07 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-50045/"&gt;Version 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I’ve been asked for a Tote kit for a Christmas preset by a friend, and
I realized I no longer have any version 4 boards. So I had to go and
order some. But if I’m ordering boards anyways, why not make some
improvements here and there? So here’s a version 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-11-10 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-48901/"&gt;Pimp Your Robot II&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;So, today I hotglued the lenses with the LEDs, updated the software to
let me switch the LEDs on and off, added a piezo to the robot, so it
makes sounds, and painted some red highlights on the legs. The end
result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-11-09 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-48853/"&gt;Pimp Your Bot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;The winter is coming, and my robots need some maintenance – after a
year of traveling to various conferences and fairs, they accumulated a
number of injuries. It’s also a good idea to recharge the lipo
batteries once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-01-29 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-30979/"&gt;The Way Forward?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;A lot has happened in the recent time for the hobbyist community, and
I’m currently wondering where I want to take this project. Here’s some
random rambling on the subject, just to clear it out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-01-23 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-30721/"&gt;Another Tote in the Wild&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Today I spent most of the day with a friend building his own instance
of Tote. Not only it was great fun, but I also learned a bit about
which parts need work (unsurprisingly, tuning and trimming the servos
is hard). We also experimented with a slightly different leg geometry
(the hip servos rotated by 90°), which gives slightly longer legs with
better reach. I think I will make it the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2016-01-07 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-30026/"&gt;Tote Zero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;So the boards have arrived and I started working on the &lt;span class="xref myst"&gt;#Tote Zero&lt;/span&gt; , an older brother of Tote, powered by the Pi Zero board. That doesn’t
mean Tote is dead or deprecated or anything, of course. I will
continue working on all my project in the same erratic and chaotic
manner I did before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-12-20 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-29288/"&gt;PyBoard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;There is a version of Tote using PyBoard as its brains: &lt;span class="xref myst"&gt;#Micropython Quadruped Robot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-12-04 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-28670/"&gt;Pi Zero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;With the new Pi Zero board and its price, it may actually make sense
to use in in place of the Arduino on Tote. It’s only a little bit more
expensive, after all. The problem is, it doesn’t have hardware PWM and
has a whole operating system that needs to boot, has to be properly
configured and requires all the right software. The cost of the SD
card also cannot be ignored. All the adapters and cables are not a
problem, as it wouldn’t need them while connected to the robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-12-02 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-28596/"&gt;Micro:Tote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I almost had the Raspberry Pi thing working last time, and I promised
to get it to work, but not just yet. The last two weeks I had a
different project on my mind. I was participating in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://microworldtour.github.io/microbit/monifa.html"&gt;Micro World Tour&lt;/a&gt; , a program that gets a couple of the micro:bit boards into the hands
of Python hackers to do something nice with its Micropython
implementation. So, obviously, I had to put it on Tote. Just imagine
every kid in UK building their own quadruped robot and doing amazing
stuff with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-11-21 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-28167/"&gt;I²C Slave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I have done a little bit of progress towards putting a Raspberry Pi on
Tote. You see, I didn’t want to make it communicate over serial,
because I’ve done that already with ESP8266 (see previous logs). This
time I wanted something more ambitious, so I decided to use I²C. As
the first step, I completely rebuilt one of my robot prototypes, to
use the new PCB and to also leave the top side of the PCB as flat as
possible – it only has the Pro Mini and the servo horns there, and
all the rest is on the bottom side. I also added a voltage regulator
giving a steady 5V, so that I can power the Raspberry Pi with it. The
Pro Mini still uses only 3.3V, but it’s fine with 5V, as it has an
internal regulator. Servos actually work better at 5V, as it’s within
its parameters, unlike the 3.7V, which was a bit low. Finally, I
replaced the 1S 3.7V LiPo battery with a 2S one, so that the regulator
has something to drop from (the boost converters that I have all have
a 500mA shutoff, so they are not suitable for powering 12 servos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-11-05 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-27566/"&gt;Nothing Happens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I have been a little bit busy with other things recently, and I didn’t
update this project for a while, so I thought that it’s time to write
something just to let you all know that it’s not abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-10-22 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-26905/"&gt;Another Batch of PCBs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;The last few weeks have been very busy, with all the conferences,
sickness, day job, etc. so I fell a little behind with my plan to have
regular experiments published here. Hopefully that will improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-09-25 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-25845/"&gt;Vertical Climb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;A small robot walking around your desk or even around your room on the
floor is one thing. The same robot climbing your furniture and able to
get everywhere in your room is a completely different game! That’s why
I always wanted to make Tote able to climb. Unfortunately, the problem
is harder than it seems at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-09-04 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-24644/"&gt;Weight Lifting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I’ve been recently asked how much weight can Tote carry. So far I had
to give a honest answer, that I don’t know. The heaviest I had it
carry was a pack of 4 AA batteries. So I decided to make a few tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-09-03 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-24608/"&gt;Making Tote without a PCB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Seeing how most of robots based on or inspired by Tote don’t actually
use the original printed circuit board, I conclude that ordering one
is the main pain point. I don’t really see why, because it’s not very
expensive and the waiting time is about the same as with ordering the
servos and all the other parts. And it’s not like you won’t find a use
for the other 9 boards, as they are pretty much generic servo breakout
boards. They are just shaped in a way that makes it easy to attach the
legs. Anyways, I decided to explain how you can build Tote with just a
proto-board, like &lt;span class="xref myst"&gt;#Tote in the Wild&lt;/span&gt;  and &lt;span class="xref myst"&gt;#Micropython Quadruped Robot&lt;/span&gt; . Let’s start with the connections (note that the connections for your
IR sensor may be different):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-28 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-24255/"&gt;Totes in the Wild&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;The main goal of all this work I’m doing on Tote is to make people
build their own robots. The idea is that they can start with Tote (or
the elements of Tote that they like), and grow from there.
Unfortunately, so far nobody that I know of decided to try it. Until
recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-25 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-24016/"&gt;Out of the Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;This project is not one of the 100 projects that qualified to the
semifinals of the Hackaday Prize 2015. And no wonder, with 900 of
great projects that entered, the chances were slim. It was still great
fun to participate and I won some very nice swag in the process! Keep
on tracking the contest, as it will only get more interesting with
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-15 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-22817/"&gt;Version 4 of PCB Documented&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;After building two prototypes and testing them, I decided to make the
version 4 of the PCB the default in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tote.readthedocs.org/"&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt; . There are also &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tote.readthedocs.org/en/latest/assembly_v4.html"&gt;updated assembly instructions&lt;/a&gt;  with lots of photos. Don’t worry, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tote.readthedocs.org/en/latest/assembly_v2.html"&gt;instructions for the old boards are still there&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-15 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-22895/"&gt;Proprioception Revisited: Touch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Sensing the positions of limbs and the forces acting on them is just
part of the proprioception, there is also the sense of touch and the
inner ear. Today we will do touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-15 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-22871/"&gt;Hackaday Prize Quaterfinals Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I decided to make it a bloopers video, showing the stages of
development of this robot and how it reached the current form. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-14 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-22768/"&gt;System Diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;This is the diagram of my plan to improve the worldwide robot
situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-14 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-22775/"&gt;Licenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;To be eligible for the Hackaday Prize, I have to explicitly document
the licenses for everything. So here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-12 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-22595/"&gt;New New Board in the Wild&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;So the version 4 printed circuit boards arrived a few days ago (no,
that’s not super-fast shipping from China, I just waited several weeks
before even writing about them). I’m almost perfectly happy with them,
so far I only came up with two small things I want to change. Probably
not enough to make another version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-08-01 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-21962/"&gt;New New Printed Circuit Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;You know how it is. As soon as you get your hands on the new PCB and
assemble another prototype to test it, you get a million ideas for
improvements to it. That’s what happened when I got the version 3 of
the Tote’s body, and it lead to a complete overhaul in version 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-30 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-21869/"&gt;Follow Me, I Say!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I didn’t have much time to work on Tote this week, but since the
sensors arrived, I will at least finish the “follow me” log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-24 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-21465/"&gt;Follow Me!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Some time ago I got the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote-affordable-spider-robot/log/20790-distance-sensor-second-try"&gt;Sharp distance sensor to work with Tote&lt;/a&gt;  (somewhat), and I promised we will do something interesting with it.
Obstacle avoidance is old, so let’s try to make the robot follow us
instead. The idea is actually very similar to obstacle avoidance,
except that instead of avoiding obstacles, you go toward them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-21 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-21263/"&gt;Testing The New Printed Circuit Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=8923&amp;amp;accesskey=8b094bbc0000d8c4912eef9a90965aac"&gt;new PCBs&lt;/a&gt;  just arrived from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com"&gt;Dirtypcbs&lt;/a&gt;  and I started to test them. This is version three of the board, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote-affordable-spider-robot/log/20019-pcb-redesign"&gt;most of the improvements are really just for convenience or aesthetics&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-16 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-21027/"&gt;Cheap Chinese STM32 Boards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;We already saw that Tote can work with a Pro Mini, Pro Micro or Teensy
3.1 as its brains. The Teensy is especially interesting, as it gives
us a lot of pins for additional sensors and effectors. But it’s quite
expensive. Could we maybe use a cheaper ARM board instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-11 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-20824/"&gt;Custom Controller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;The newest Hackaday Prize Hot List is about human interfaces, so I
decided to work on that a little over the weekend. I found an analog
joystick module lying around, so I’m going to try and make a custom
controller for Tote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-10 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-20790/"&gt;Distance Sensor, Second Try&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Seonsors are very important for robots, and a distance sensor is one
of the most useful ones that you can install, as it gives the robot an
approximation of vision. I tried to use an ultrasound distance sensor
with Tote before, and failed miserably. This time I’m going to use an
infra-red distance sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-07 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-20586/"&gt;Logicoma-kun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;The continuous-rotation servos arrived, and I got to finish another of
my experiments, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/6321-katka-a-mammalian-robot/log/20293-spider-mode"&gt;which I mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt;  over at the &lt;span class="xref myst"&gt;#Katka, a mammalian robot&lt;/span&gt;  project. Since I’m re-using parts and experience between all those
projects, it becomes harder to separate them. This one might even grow
out into its own project, but for now I will publish it here, as it’s
basically Tote with a slightly different leg configuration and
software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-07-02 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-20344/"&gt;Using Teensy 3.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;One of the topics I intend to cover in those logs is how to extend
Tote with various boards and modules. I’ve already had one log on how
to use Pro Micro instead of Pro Mini, and one on adding an ESP8266
board with Micropython. Now it’s time for the Teensy 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-06-30 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-20241/"&gt;Schematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;I’ve been asked to provide schematics of the PCB. I must admit, that I
neglected that part a little, mostly doing all modifications and
connections directly in the PCB view, but now I cleaned up the
schematic view a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-06-26 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-20019/"&gt;PCB Redesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;After the recent failures and after using the Tote’s PCB in a couple
of different projects, I decided that some changes are needed to the
design. Here is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/tote/src/tip/fritzing/pcb3.fzz"&gt;the new PCB&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-06-23 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-19897/"&gt;Failure: HC-SR04 Distance Sensor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;What is a robot without sensors? Just a remote-controlled toy! It’s
time to add some external sensors to Tote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-06-17 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-19645/"&gt;Remote control with ESP8266 and Micropython&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Raspberry Pi now requires at least 3GB SD card for its system image,
and turns out I don’t have any that big around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-06-10 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-19284/"&gt;Using Arduino Pro Micro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;You can use Arduino Nano instead of the Pro Mini in Tote, if you
prefer to have that USB socket available. Apart from the fact that the
Nano has the USB2TTL build into it, there are no differences, so it
should all work. However, I don’t have a spare Nano around, so I
haven’t actually tested it. Caveats may appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-06-09 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-19236/"&gt;Dirty PCBs are dirty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;For everyone who have ordered the PCB for Tote from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=6918&amp;amp;accesskey=97f6a684899c11fcc50da07808869f5d"&gt;Dirty PCBs&lt;/a&gt;  just a quick note. Remember, that it’s the cut-throat cheap
prototyping boards, and mistakes do happen. They are often simple to
work around, but do test your boards for shorts before soldering
anything or, especially, connecting a battery to the soldered board. I
just had another batch arrive, and there is a small mistake on them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-06-04 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-18992/"&gt;Proprioception on the Cheap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Remember that time when you sat on your leg for some time, and it got
numb, and when you got up, it felt all wooden and walking was like
walking on stilts? That’s how most walking robots feel. What happened
is your nerves got squished and blocked a little, and you lost your &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception"&gt;sense of proprioception&lt;/a&gt;  – the position and forces of your limbs. Now you know why robots
that don’t have force and position sensors on them have such a hard
time walking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-05-31 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-18736/"&gt;Hacking on Tote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Since Tote evolved from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/3300-kubik-quadruped-robot"&gt;µKubik&lt;/a&gt; , I put all updates about it there. But now that it is pretty much
ready, I’m going to do some experimenting and extending and hacking on
it, and I think it makes sense to have a separate project page for
that, and leave the Python-powered µKubik alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="ablog-post"&gt;&lt;p class="ablog-post-title"&gt;2015-05-31 - &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/log-6050-18738/"&gt;Different Power Sources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;Power source is a hard problem for any walking or flying robots.
Unlike the robots that roll on wheels (or tracks), walkers have to
carry its own weight, and the battery can be easily the heaviest part
of the robot. They also tend to draw quite a lot of current for their
many actuators, so that further limits the choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
