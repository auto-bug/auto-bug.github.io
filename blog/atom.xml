    <title>Gangsta</title>
    <updated>2017-01-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="gangsta"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2017-01-15 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../projects/project-6050/#project-6050"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Tote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in the previous logs, I’m going to be upgrading Tote to use
some more expensive, but more powerful and easier to use components.
But what about the poor students? If you are really concerned about
the budget, the original Tote is almost what you need. Almost, because
you would still need to order the PCB for it. Or would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not! The PCB doesn’t have anything you can’t easily
reproduce on a vero/strip/perma board! Here’s one example of a Tote on
a strip board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6050/images/5143501484479792847.png" src="projects/project-6050/images/5143501484479792847.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you will need to remap the pins in the code, but that should be
quite easy. Yes, I went wild in Fritzing, and it’s barely readable.
Here’s a clearer picture of the strip board you will need to make:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6050/images/6940371484479875736.png" src="projects/project-6050/images/6940371484479875736.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even has the voltage divider for monitoring the battery. Oh, right,
and don’t use alkaline batteries like on the picture. Use a LiPo from
a quadcopter or from an old cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that one thing they say about Fritzing is true: it
sucks for making schematics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6050/images/3958631484480008034.png" src="projects/project-6050/images/3958631484480008034.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if I should fork this version off the main Tote, and keep a
repository with the Arduino code for it, with remapped pins and so
on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Crazy Custom Colors</title>
    <updated>2017-03-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="crazy-custom-colors"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2017-03-15 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../projects/project-7860/#project-7860"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Nyan Board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this year, DirtyPCBs announced a new service: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/store/panels/details/1/mystery_color"&gt;Mystery Color PCB Group Buy&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/store/panels/details/1/mystery_color"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . The idea is similar to what OSHPark does – you get 3 PCBs and get
charged by the surface area. But there is a twist – they are going to
experiment with various soldermask color combinations, and you never
know what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to try this, and made an order for the single Nyan Board –
because I thought it would be fun to have it in a crazy color. The
example PCB on the picture is pink, so I expected something flashy. I
made my order on February 05, 2017. Today is March 15, 2017 and the PCBs arrived. I have to admit that
this is a bit longer than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never mind that, what are the new exciting colors? I have to admit
that I am a little bit disappointed here too. Here’s a photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-7860/images/6059241489574405659.jpg" src="projects/project-7860/images/6059241489574405659.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the boards are mostly naked FR4. The soldermask is
present only where there is either copper or silkscreen – all the
other areas are simply unpainted. That pretty much ruins everything.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soldermask itself is a kind of body color orange, which might be
interesting for human figures or faces, if only you knew the color in
advance and could somehow get the whole board covered in it. The
silkscreen is pretty much standard unexciting black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I ordered 3 boards, and I received 11, which is a
bit strange, but I guess a good deal for $4 with shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="update"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with DirtyPCBs, I examined my boards closely, and
realized how wrong and unfair I was. The soldermask is not_missing_ from between the copper traces. And it’s not orange – that orange is
just the color of copper traces covered with it. Yes.**The soldermask is transparent!**This opens a lot of possibilities for novel designs, although I still
have to say that it would look much better if the FR4 underneath was
some other color than the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, they refunded it to me completely, and now I feel like a
complete jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Reviving the Skull Tote</title>
    <updated>2018-06-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="reviving-the-skull-tote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2018-06-07 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../projects/project-6050/#project-6050"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Tote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a number of prototypes of Tote that I have built over the
years, but the most presentable one is the one I pimped up in  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote/log/48853-pimp-your-bot"&gt;https://hackaday.io/project/6050-tote/log/48853-pimp-your-bot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that robot had a number of problems. Unlike all other
Totes, it was powered with a 2S lipo battery, with a buck converter
bringing to voltage down to 5V. That tiny buck converter would only
work for a few minutes, and then starting to shut down when the
current drawn by the servos made it too hot. Which would result in the
robot having a seizure. I also discovered that the motor in one of the
servos got stuck — rather common with the cheap SG90 servos — and
would need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to open up this robot, replace the power with a more
standard setup (a 1S lipo connected directly without any voltage
stabilization), add a battery charging circuit, and replace the servo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the USB port for the battery charging circuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6050/images/9036641528398127759.jpg" src="projects/project-6050/images/9036641528398127759.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the replaced servo, primed with black paint, waiting to dry for a
dry-brushing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6050/images/2825991528398180978.jpg" src="projects/project-6050/images/2825991528398180978.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally the whole robot, it all its robot glory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6050/images/7540951528398222731.jpg" src="projects/project-6050/images/7540951528398222731.jpg" /&gt;

    <title>Corrected Repositories</title>
    <updated>2018-06-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="corrected-repositories"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2018-06-24 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../projects/project-7860/#project-7860"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Nyan Board&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/125739"&gt;&amp;#64;Travis Hardiman &lt;/a&gt; pointed out that the code I have in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;  in the attiny10 branch is actually for attiny85, and the attiny10
code is missing, so I went ahead and re-created the attiny10 code
(which I must have lost somehow), this time on attiny9 (which is the
same as attiny10, only doesn’t have ADC, which we don’t need). It’s in
the attiny9 branch now. So to summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;attiny85:  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;attiny10 and attiny9: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny9/main/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;attiny13:  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny10/main/"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/thesheep/nyan/src/tiny13/main/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, to program the attiny10, you need to use a programmer capable of
programming with the TPI protocol — recent versions of USBASP support
it, you just need to add a 1kΩ resistor…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Still Alive</title>
    <updated>2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="still-alive"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2019-01-01 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../projects/project-7168/#project-7168"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Logicoma-kun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recharged my batteries during the holiday break enough to actually
work on this project a little bit more. One of the reasons I didn’t
touch it for over two years is that it’s not really very convenient to
program. I mean sure, it runs MicroPython, but to program it you
either have to disconnect from the Internet and connect to its WiFi,
or connect a USB to serial converter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———- more ———-I realized that I can as well just make use of the progress I have
made in the mean time, and use the &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-13278&lt;/span&gt; together with a D1 Mini clone:\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-7168/images/2164301546298974291.jpg" src="projects/project-7168/images/2164301546298974291.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In place of the custom ESP-3 with a Pro Micro, that I had in there
previously.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-7168/images/7620761546298953806.jpg" src="projects/project-7168/images/7620761546298953806.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also need some kind of a controller for it, but that will
probably be a separate project. In any case, the very next step now is
to get it to actually walk and ride around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
