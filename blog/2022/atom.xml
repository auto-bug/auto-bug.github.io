    <title>Kos v2.0</title>

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2022-11-21 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../projects/project-10408/#project-10408"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Steno Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kos 1.0 I used a pro mini board for the microcontroller, because
that was the traditional way at the time, and it had the most
widespread support. But it’s an old microcontroller and the board is
hard to get and expensive during the chip shortage, when the chip fabs
are busy churning out chips for the missiles, so I decided to revisit
this design and this time use something modern – the Raspberry Pi
Pico, which is both cheap and available, at least until the military
designs catch up with the new chip technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more pins available on each side, and with the board being mostly
symmetrical, I could simplify the design greatly. I no longer need to
connect the rows across the two halves, and I can simply have all
horizontal traces on one side, and all vertical traces on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the previous versions, you need two of the PCBs to make one
keyboard, and you connect them by soldering a pro micro in the middle.
Since QMK now supports RP2040, there shouldn’t be any problem with the
firmware, but I will probably use the CircuitPython code I already
wrote for the other stenotype, or maybe try and get the USB HID steno
protocol working. The Pi Pico opens a lot of possibilities, even
putting a simplified version of Plover together with the dictionary on
the board itself, and emulating a HID keyboard should be doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the PCBs and parts should arrive within two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
