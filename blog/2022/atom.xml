    <title>The PCB Design</title>
    <updated>2022-12-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2022-12-30 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-188908&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first project where I completely switched to EasyEDA as a
PCB design tool. I honestly tried KiCAD several times over the years,
and it’s just so hilariously bad at exploring designs, that I gave up
on it. EasyEDA is still far from ideal (especially the copper fills),
but it’s not completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I followed up on my fluffbug work, of course, but I made
everything except for the battery holder surface-mount. I found some
pretty nice low-profile smd female headers on LCSC, and the IDC
connectors for the servos also exist in SMD versions. This actually
gives me much more room on the PCB, because headers no longer take up
both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188908/images/4419021672440629343.png" src="projects/project-188908/images/4419021672440629343.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188908/images/7571221672440647456.png" src="projects/project-188908/images/7571221672440647456.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still a few pilot holes for all the components, so there was
some work squeezing it all to fit, but in the end it came out rather
compact. Since the headers are double-row, I can use them to add
bigger “face” shields for the robot, with things like displays,
cameras, sensors or speakers. In fact, I went ahead and designed two
shields, one the size of the pico with a camera, and one bigger, with
an oled display and a speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2.0 Already!</title>
    <updated>2022-12-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="already"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2022-12-31 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-188909&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at my PCB design today with fresh eyes, and I found a mistake
in how the power is routed, which would require a bodge. So I used
that as an excuse to re-design it with the 14250 battery holder, which
also made it much smaller. And since you can add designs to an
existing order in JLCPCB, I did just that. So the 1.0 version will be
obsolete on arrival, sadly, but I will get to build a much smaller
robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188909/images/5688921672515769751.png" src="projects/project-188909/images/5688921672515769751.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188909/images/7722411672515787420.png" src="projects/project-188909/images/7722411672515787420.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also went ahead and designed a PCB for the mechanical parts of the
legs. I was lucky to not get hit by the panelization penalization, but
it’s fine for a one-off design like this. If I were making more units,
I would go for laser-cut parts instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything Works!</title>
    <updated>2022-12-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;The PCBs arrived in the break between holidays, and I got to assemble
one of each. First the Raspberry Pi Pico shield:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182342/images/2751821672516614090.jpg" src="projects/project-182342/images/2751821672516614090.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182342/images/8828861672516640197.jpg" src="projects/project-182342/images/8828861672516640197.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it without the crystal first, with a bodge wire to a free pin
to generate the master clock with PWM. Once I had it verified working
that way, I removed the bodge and soldered the 24MHz crystal, and it
works flawlessly. Then I moved on to the S2 Mini shield:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182342/images/4149041672516738780.jpg" src="projects/project-182342/images/4149041672516738780.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested the previous version of this with the crystal connected with
bodge wires, and it didn’t work, so I had very little hope for this,
but turns out it was the fault of the bodge wires, and it works
perfectly fine with the crystal soldered on the PCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this pretty much concludes the project. I will make the
design files available, and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>PCB Design</title>
    <updated>2022-12-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="pcb-design"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2022-12-31 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-188909&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I measured the servos, and quickly designed a PCB similar to the one
used in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-180025&lt;/span&gt; , but proportionally smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188909/images/91721672442475030.png" src="projects/project-188909/images/91721672442475030.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave up on the IDC connectors for the servos, and just went with the
1.25mm JST sockets. Instead of the Lolin S2 Mini, I decided to use
either the Adafruit Qt Py board, or Seeedstudio Xiao – as it happens,
they have the same pinouts, so I can decide later, or even switch
between them. All the rest is pretty much the same as in Fluffbug, but
since there was some free space, I also added a footprint for an
optional infrared sensor, so that I can use a tv remote to control the
robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last problem is the battery. I didn’t want to use the pouch lipo
batteries, because they are not standard and pretty dangerous, so I
looked at what standard battery size would fit it. Eventually, I
decided on LIR2450 (or the bigger LIR2477 version), and added a coin
cell battery holder to the PCB. The contacts stick out a bit, but I
can just cut them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188909/images/852881672442795666.png" src="projects/project-188909/images/852881672442795666.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course as my luck has it, as soon as I ordered the PCBs, I found
out the perfect battery size that would make it look exactly as
Fluffbug, only smaller: the 14250 cells. There is even a holder for it
that looks identical to the one in Fluffbug, just smaller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188909/images/1668661672442921859.jpg" src="projects/project-188909/images/1668661672442921859.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at how cute it is! In the end, I decided to order some of
those cells and holders as well, and I will try to bodge them on the
PCB somehow.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>The OLED Face</title>
    <updated>2022-12-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="the-oled-face"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2022-12-31 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-188908&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCBs arrived right after the holidays, and I quickly assembled
one, moved the whole legs from one of my fluffbugs, and here it is,
all working as expected. I just had to update the pin names in my
circuitpython code, that’s literally it. But then I decided to try and
get to work one of the shields – the one with a display and a speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-188908/images/9751991672441425672.jpg" src="projects/project-188908/images/9751991672441425672.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The display just worked. I used the SH1106 library for displayio, and
I just had to rotate the display 180° and add a 2-pixel horizontal
shift to adapt it to this particular display. I got really good with
that working on all those handheld game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker turned out to be a bit more challenging. I used a
MAX98357A I2S amplifier, because I had that on a module earlier and I
was confident it works well. Well, despite the schematic being
practically the same with the module (minus some unnecessary caps, as
usual), this one didn’t work. The chip is a bit small QFN package, but
visually it looked soldered well. I tried a lot of different things,
until at fifth re-soldering of the chip with the hot-air gun, it
suddenly started working. I suppose looking good is not enough. Of
course with such a tiny speaker the quality is questionable, but it
does sound properly robotic, and it’s surprisingly loud (I hardwired
the amplifier to maximum gain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
