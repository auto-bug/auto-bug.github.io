    <title>Why?</title>
    <updated>2019-07-04T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="why"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2019-07-04 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-166370&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used one of those tiny 8x8 LED matrices? Have you
noticed anything peculiar about their pinout? Here’s something to
refresh your memory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-166370/images/1306331562231254088.png" src="projects/project-166370/images/1306331562231254088.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only it’s totally random, without a rhyme or reason, but also the
only diagram you have to go by is backwards, giving your pin numbers
in reference to physical locations of the LEDs, instead of giving your
physical locations of the pins in reference to row and column numbers.
Sure, you can work it out on paper, but it’s easy to make a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry, we have a technological solution to this obvious
problem! Introducing Matrix Sanitizer, which is basically just a tiny
little PCB that rearranges the pins for you into a saner
configuration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-166370/images/8230551562231552644.png" src="projects/project-166370/images/8230551562231552644.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-166370/images/4276261562231562461.png" src="projects/project-166370/images/4276261562231562461.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to years of research of our best engineers, it does it without
any vias, while keeping the same pin spacing, and even lets you insert
the male pin headers without soldering (the matrix still needs to be
soldered for good electrical contact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom rows are the anodes, and the top row are the cathodes. The
PCB goes flat against the bottom of the matrix, only making it 1.6mm
higher. The resulting contraption fits into a prototyping breadboard
perfectly, and because it uses regular goldpins in place of those
flimsy thin legs, it provides excellent contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>The Wrong Matrix</title>
    <updated>2019-07-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="the-wrong-matrix"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2019-07-20 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-166370&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since selling just the PCB would be pretty weird (you can just order
it from &amp;#64;oshpark yourself, and it would be cheaper, considering the
shipping), I ordered a whole bunch of those 20mm matrices &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1511523876.html"&gt;from the usual sources&lt;/a&gt; . Unfortunately, when the package arrived today, I had a bit of a
surprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-166370/images/7055011563623103230.JPG" src="projects/project-166370/images/7055011563623103230.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m holding a 20x20mm, 1.9mm per LED, 788AS matrix. In the box is what
came instead: 32x32mm, 3mm per LED, 1088AS matrices. I’m pretty sure
that is a mistake on their part, since those matrices are much more
expensive, but it’s still very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have several options. I can negotiate with the seller, and maybe
they will replace them — then I’m back to my original plan. I can make
a bigger version of the matrix sanitizer and sell that — but those
bigger matrices don’t fit the breadboards as well as the small ones
do. Or I could come up with some other project that utilizes those
matrices, possibly a lot of them all at once. For now I let the seller
know and we will see where that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Bi-color Breadboard Adapter</title>
    <updated>2019-09-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="bi-color-breadboard-adapter"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2019-09-10 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-166370&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the matrix sanitizer, here’s a similar board that
solves a slightly different problem: those bi-color LED matrices that
have three rows of pins are impossible to insert into a breadboard. So
we need something to make it two rows of pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-166370/images/206861568138961046.png" src="projects/project-166370/images/206861568138961046.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This board does that for you. You can order it from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216"&gt;&amp;#64;oshpark&lt;/a&gt; :  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/iOwHMYcW"&gt;https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/iOwHMYcW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly happy that I managed to make it one-layer and
symmetric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
