    <title>Programming</title>
    <updated>2021-12-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="programming"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2021-12-09 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-182998/#project-182998"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Kleks Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is left is to program it. As usual, I wanted to use
CircuitPython, with my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb"&gt;ukeeb&lt;/a&gt;  library. I flashed the bootloader with a JLink through a header I
temporarily soldered to the stitches in the middle, and then I flashed
the most recent CircuitPython. I’m using the board definition I made
for &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-171381/#project-171381"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Fluff M0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , because it exposes all the pins of the SAMD21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next it’s time to decide on the layout. For now I am using something
like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182998/images/8992751639080387066.png" src="projects/project-182998/images/8992751639080387066.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels on the bottom of the keys is what happens when you hold the
key and press another one. There are two traditional layers, switched
with the Raise and Lower keys. One thing I added compared to my
previous keyboard, is that if you press Raise and Backspace, you get
Lower, and if you press Lower and Space you get Raise — this way you
can type with one hand with access to both layers. This helps when
playing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely happy with the modifier keys yet, I will probably
reshuffle them somewhat, and I will probably swap the arrows keys and
the home/end and pgup/pgdn layers. Otherwise it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>The PCBs</title>
    <updated>2021-12-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="the-pcbs"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2021-12-09 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-182998/#project-182998"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Kleks Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed the PCB for this keyboard the same way as the two-part
split keyboards are often designed: the same PCB is used as the left
and right part, with switch footprints on both sides, so that it can
be flipped. However, in this case I only have a microcontroller on one
side, so all the connections from the other half need to be brought
over thorough a connector joining the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182998/images/7937791639079594678.png" src="projects/project-182998/images/7937791639079594678.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182998/images/5529981639079604993.png" src="projects/project-182998/images/5529981639079604993.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically the board has three rows and a dozen columns, which means
that I need at least nine traces to cross to the other side. I made it
12 by also adding the connectors for power, ground and reset — they
are not needed on the other side of the board, but they are useful for
programming the board, and this way I didn’t have to add a separate
connector for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before you ask, yes, the holes are purely decorative. I just like
how they look, and that part of the PCB was empty anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>NKRO and BOOT</title>
    <updated>2021-12-10T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="nkro-and-boot"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2021-12-10 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-182998/#project-182998"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Kleks Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the opportunity with this new keyboard and worked a bit on my
uKeeb CircuitPython library. With the custom HID descriptors we can
have an NKRO keyboard, but there is a small problem: the bitmap device
that this uses won’t work in BIOS or with legacy KVM devices, as those
expect a BOOT device. Fortunately there is a way around that: when the
host expects a BOOT device, it must send you a special message telling
you that, so we can switch to that protocol when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support for receiving that message was recently added to
CircuitPython in version 7.1.0, so we can now add the NKRO code to the
library by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the details, feel free to check the library
code at  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb"&gt;https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thinking about V2</title>
    <updated>2021-12-27T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="thinking-about-v2"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2021-12-27 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-182998/#project-182998"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Kleks Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using this keyboard some time, and it’s close to perfect,
but there are several things that could be still improved in my
opinion, so I went ahead and re-designed the PCB a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182998/images/6801821640559279267.png" src="projects/project-182998/images/6801821640559279267.png" /&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182998/images/9579491640559291480.png" src="projects/project-182998/images/9579491640559291480.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a little stagger to the inner columns, because it was a bit
hard to reach the T and Y keys. I also lowered the middle finger
column a bit, because the stagger there was a bit much. The pinky
cluster stays as it is, because it is perfect — I didn’t even move it
the 3mm needed to align it with the new keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a cluster for the cursor keys, because having them on a layer
is not convenient, and I’m not touch-typing when I’m cursoring
anyways. Since the board is by necessity symmetric, I will also have
some extra keys on the other side — I will put the rarely used
modifier keys there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I added a place for a CapsLock LED, though I never use it.
But there were free pins, so why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layout will look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-182998/images/8332081640559601607.png" src="projects/project-182998/images/8332081640559601607.png" /&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
