    <title>Walking Details</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been asked to provide another video of this robot walking, with a
better angle, so that the exact movements can be more easily seen. So
here it is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reworked Electronics</title>
    <updated>2015-06-26T00:00:00+02:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2015-06-26 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-6321/#project-6321"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Katka, a mammalian robot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have a couple of new boards for &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-6050/#project-6050"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Tote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , I decided to re-make the electronics for Katka. I got rid of the
boost converter and the huge capacitor, using a 3.3V Pro Mini instead
of the 5V. I also soldered all the parts on one side of the board, so
that it can be attached easily with screws at the top of the robot.
The battery is still just strapped to the front – it has to be there
for the center of gravity to be in the right place, unless I bite the
bullet and rework the legs too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also fixed a very silly bug in the code, which made it ignore all TV
remote commands. I still have a quite bad bug in the rotation code
somewhere, so turning is not very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spider Mode</title>
    <updated>2015-07-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="spider-mode"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2015-07-01 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-6321/#project-6321"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Katka, a mammalian robot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finally decided to kill one of my failed projects, the
Pico-Kubik (pKubik for short). It was the third robot in the series,
following &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-3300/#project-3300"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;µKubik quadruped robot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . It was supposed to be smaller and cheaper by the virtue of only
using 8 servos, 2 per each leg, and doing inverse kinematics through
solving a complicated set of non-linear equations, for all legs at
once. The idea was that while I can’t position accurately each leg in
3D with only 2 degrees of freedom per leg, I can do it if I use all
the legs together, and ignore the position of the body itself. While I
still think it may be doable, the complexity of required math defeated
me, and the robot was standing there on the shelf, waiting for its
turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I decided to disassemble it, and reassemble into a
younger sister of &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-6321/#project-6321"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Katka, a mammalian robot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . I’ve been complaining that Katka’s leg construction is sub-optimal
and needs rebuilding, but since that requires physical changes, and I
don’t have a version control system for the physical world, I was
reluctant to break an otherwise perfectly fine robot. So now, with 8
spare servos to use, I could just build another Katka from scratch,
but with a different leg configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have this idea at the back of my mind, of building a working &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://grabcad.com/library/logicoma-1"&gt;Logicoma model&lt;/a&gt; , that would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-6321/images/3021291435744764582.png" src="projects/project-6321/images/3021291435744764582.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this is basically Katka, but with the legs a little
more spread out, and with additional continuous-rotation servos for
the wheels. The angled wheels would let it turn by moving the legs
forward and backward. So, I needed to confirm that this configuration
will indeed walk well, and maybe later add the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, here’s the robot walking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="None" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rg6Nodhyvvs"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem I had is that since the center of mass is much lower in
this one, I needed to tilt the body sideways much further then in
Katka to make sure the center of gravity moves far away from the leg
being raised. I suppose that with the greater leg range that this
configuration gives, I could also move the body forward and backward a
little, to improve that. But generally I’m very happy with how it
works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
