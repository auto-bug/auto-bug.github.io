    <title>Version 8.2 of the PCB</title>
    <updated>2023-01-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="version-8-2-of-the-pcb"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-01-19 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-180025&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with migrating to all-SMD components (except for the battery
holder), I also migrated with my PCB designs from Fritzing to EasyEDA.
It’s not as conductive to experimenting and just playing with things,
but at least it’s not openly hostile to it like KiCad is, and comes
with a huge library of footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, the latest version of the PCB is published at  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://u.easyeda.com/account/user/projects/index/detail?project=ec4ce18f172848fc80a110ab474689c6"&gt;https://u.easyeda.com/account/user/projects/index/detail?project=ec4ce
18f172848fc80a110ab474689c6&lt;/a&gt;  together with the schematic and the BOM. However, be careful about
the female pin headers, you probably want to get some low-profile ones
instead of those used in the footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Assembly Instructions</title>
    <updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="assembly-instructions"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-01-30 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-180025&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a workshop quickly approaching, it’s time to spend some effort on
the documentation. This time I want to make some IKEA-like step-by-
step instructions, so I had to figure out a process for generating the
images of the robot parts. Of course I already have an OpenSCAD model
of the robot, I just had to update it a little and add some detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-180025/images/6311041675158783568.gif" src="projects/project-180025/images/6311041675158783568.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I parametrized the part positions, so that I can easily “explode” the
whole thing, showing individual components. But this kind of image is
too busy and looks bad when printed on paper in monochrome, so the
next step is turning it into a wireframe. After some searching, I
found an STL viewer that can do that, so I generated an STL of the
robot from OpenSCAD and fed it to the viewer. I got something like
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-180025/images/4989841675117427387.png" src="projects/project-180025/images/4989841675117427387.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much closer to what I want, but there is still a lot of
unnecessary detail cluttering the picture and making it hard to see
clearly what comes where. So the next step is some manual cleanup in
GIMP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-180025/images/7722791675157849157.png" src="projects/project-180025/images/7722791675157849157.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what I wanted. Next, I quickly generated scad files
for the individual steps of the assembly, and repeated the process to
get the illustrations. An (almost) finished guide looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-180025/images/6004011675117619488.png" src="projects/project-180025/images/6004011675117619488.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need to make the image for step 4, but I’m not sure I want to
use OpenSCAD or something else for it. It has to show the orientation
and order of the servo cables in the IDC plugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I also updated the git repository to include version
8.2 of the PCB and the new leg design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Bits’n’Bolts Robot Workshop</title>
    <updated>2023-02-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="bits-n-bolts-robot-workshop"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-02-20 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-180025&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might have mentioned this already, we are preparing a workshop here
in Zürich for building a bunch of Fluffbug robots:  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.bitsnbolts.ch/programm/fluffbug-robot-workshop"&gt;https://www.bitsnbolts.ch/programm/fluffbug-robot-workshop&lt;/a&gt; . You have to register, because the number of places is limited, and
you also have to pay for the workshop separately from the the main
event, but I hope it will be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you saw in the previous log, I’m working on clear assembly
instructions, but we also need to prepare the kits. Almost all parts
have already arrived, but I’m still waiting for the servos – that is
going to be a big box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-180025/images/8580181676904492606.jpg" src="projects/project-180025/images/8580181676904492606.jpg" /&gt;

    <title>After the Workshop</title>
    <updated>2023-03-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="after-the-workshop"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-03-05 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-180025&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote previously, we just had a small workshop at a local art
festival for building Fluffbug robots. I think it generally went very
well: all the participants left with working robots, and they didn’t
seem to have regretted spending those four hours there. I call it a
win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-180025/images/4071841678047909996.jpg" src="projects/project-180025/images/4071841678047909996.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is always some room for improvement, so I’m going to
put some notes here.\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/sheep/dev/ablog/deshipu.art/projects/project-180025/log-216508.md&lt;/span&gt;, line 28)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-consecutive header level increase; H1 to H3 [myst.header]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;section id="duration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Duration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hours seems to be the perfect length of the workshop. There was
one person who came 2 hours late, and while they did finish their
robot, they had to hurry and it didn’t come out as good as it could
have. And that is without the soldering part – I chickened at the last
moment and soldered up all the pins for the participants, because the
soldering irons we were going to have available weren’t that great.
With soldering, it would probably take half an hour to one hour
longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways in which I could speed it up a little by providing some
partially assembled components, but that feels like taking away the
fun, so I think I will stick to four hours in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, we did have a break planned in the middle, but nobody
wanted to take it. They were too engrossed in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/sheep/dev/ablog/deshipu.art/projects/project-180025/log-216508.md&lt;/span&gt;, line 47)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-consecutive header level increase; H1 to H3 [myst.header]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="tools"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to bring good screwdrivers, preferably in two sizes, for the
tiny screws and for the servo screws. Many people were frustrated
using the sub-premium screwdrivers available at the hackerspace. I see
myself in a tool shop in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the other tools, like wire cutters, pliers and scissors were only
needed for a moment and were easily shared. We didn’t do soldering, so
no soldering irons. I might consider bringing some cork coasters, so
people can use them when screwing the screws in and not damage the
tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/sheep/dev/ablog/deshipu.art/projects/project-180025/log-216508.md&lt;/span&gt;, line 61)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-consecutive header level increase; H1 to H3 [myst.header]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="calibration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Calibration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely need to add LED signalling to the calibration process, so
you can be sure when all the servos have updated. This version of
CircuitPython takes some random delay before it resets (a mitigation
for a number of bugs), so it was frustrating changing the calibration
values and than waiting not being sure if it updated yet or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was afraid the people would struggle with the process or find it
tiresome, but it doesn’t seem they did. Not everyone had a computer,
but people did the calibration for those without computers on theirs,
so there was no problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/sheep/dev/ablog/deshipu.art/projects/project-180025/log-216508.md&lt;/span&gt;, line 75)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-consecutive header level increase; H1 to H3 [myst.header]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="idc-connectors"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IDC Connectors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the IDC connectors were the source of the most problems,
and also the most scary part of the whole assembly. It’s easy to
introduce a short if the cables are not perfectly aligned while
crimping the connector, and then the robot just stands there, because
the battery protection chip cuts the power. It’s better than releasing
the magical blue smoke, of course, but here again a LED indicator for
the calibration process would help a lot, to at least see if there is
power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the right lengths of the cables was a problem as well, as
people were understandably afraid of cutting them too short. I think I
should prepare some kind of a jig, where you insert the servos at one
end, and the connectors at the other, which would give you the right
lengths of the cables and also keep the cables aligned. I need to
think about how to do it, but probably laser-cutting something will
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also considering cutting and crimping the cables beforehand, to
eliminate this step completely, but I’m not sure I want to do it: it’s
a lot of work, and it steals some of the experience from the
participants – even if it’s scary. I will see if a jig makes things
easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/sheep/dev/ablog/deshipu.art/projects/project-180025/log-216508.md&lt;/span&gt;, line 101)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-consecutive header level increase; H1 to H3 [myst.header]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="spare-parts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spare Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important lesson is to always bring spare parts for the kits.
People lose screws, break the plastic parts, damage the IDC connectors
trying to re-crimp them, and even strip the gears on the servos. I had
two boxes of extra screws, a set of extra leg parts, a bag of ten
additional connectors, an additional battery and an additional
microcontroller board, and we have used all of those, and without them
someone’s robot wouldn’t be working anymore. Unfortunately I didn’t
have spare servos, because I’m tight with them (I did plan to have
spare servos, but one of the packages I ordered only had 2/3 of the
servos I ordered), but maybe next time I will try to find some spares
too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;span class="docutils literal"&gt;/home/sheep/dev/ablog/deshipu.art/projects/project-180025/log-216508.md&lt;/span&gt;, line 116)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-consecutive header level increase; H1 to H3 [myst.header]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="assembly-instructions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assembly Instructions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got some feedback for changes in the assembly instructions, so
I will be adding those. It’s mostly clarifications, though. I still
can’t think of a better way of describing the IDC connector step more
clearly, perhaps the jig will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Another Workshop</title>
    <updated>2023-03-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="another-workshop"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-03-16 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-180025&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We barely finished one workshop, and we soon are going to have another
one! In less than two weeks at Berlin, during the Hackaday conference,
we are going to be building another 10 Fluffbug robots. You can read
the announcement and buy the tickets here:  &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.com/2023/03/14/hackaday-berlin-the-badge-workshops-and-lightning-talks/"&gt;https://hackaday.com/2023/03/14/hackaday-berlin-the-badge-workshops-
and-lightning-talks/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are only 10 kits, because I only have one
truckload of servos at hand, and ordering more would take much more
time than we have left, plus I still have to bring them all to Berlin
somehow, and I can fit only so much in my luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But worry not, all the design files and all the code are available in
the repository, and you can easily build your own at home. Chances are
it will be even less expensive than the workshop kit, because you
won’t have to pay for express shipping of the parts, and the packages
probably be below the tax limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, I’m soldering up the kits.&lt;/p&gt;
