    <title>Prototype</title>
    <updated>2019-11-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="prototype"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCBs arrived already, so I assembled the prototype. Of course it’s
a very easy design, so I had to do something wrong — in this case, the
holes in the switch footprint are slightly too small. I will need to
add some 0.25mm to them to make the switch fit in there, but for now I
just used the reaming tool to enlarge the holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-168395/images/457531574095988248.jpg" src="projects/project-168395/images/457531574095988248.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soldering the APA102 RGB LEDs was a bit of a challenge, but with a few
tries with a hot air gun I got them all to light up. There should be
no problem with them when done with solder paste and an oven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the holes on the sides are staggered — that means you
can insert your pin headers in there without soldering, and it will
give you good enough connection still! Of course if you get any
problems, you cal always solder them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the switches fit within the board’s outline, the key caps you
put on them might stick out a little bit to the sides, but I think
that it’s fine, as then you can make a case for the device that is
exactly flush with the key caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Schematic and Design Files</title>

&lt;p&gt;Here is the schematic of the finished design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-168395/images/4766551574110180604.png" src="projects/project-168395/images/4766551574110180604.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gerbers and the Fritzing file are available in the “files”
section. The BOM is in the “components”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You Shouldn’t Doesn’t Mean That You Can’t</title>
    <updated>2019-11-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="you-shouldn-t-doesn-t-mean-that-you-can-t"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCB for the crazy tiny keyboard arrived as well, and I had a stab
at soldering the buttons by hand. I got as far as the second button of
the second row and decided that it’s not going to work. My tiny
soldering iron tip is simply too big for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-168395/images/5176061574098010170.jpg" src="projects/project-168395/images/5176061574098010170.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might give it another try with solder paste and hot air gun, but I
really don’t have much hope for it. It’s also pretty inconvenient for
typing with your thumbs, so I guess I will just call this one a
failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Contest</title>
    <updated>2019-11-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="contest"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2019-11-19 in &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-168395&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a few words about this project in the context of the contest it was
created for. Sure, the design is very simple, and it wasn’t much work,
but I think it’s a genuinely useful product, especially for beginners.
It lets you experiment with real mechanical keyboard switches (and
some nice blinky lights) without large risk usually involved in making
a large expensive keyboard. It fits several of the contest categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weirdest Feather — fine, maybe it’s not so weird — not as weird as
the &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-19921&lt;/span&gt; or the &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-168441&lt;/span&gt; . But it’s not your usual “sensor breakout” add-on either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll Cut Yourself On That Edge — it so happens that the Kailh
chocolate switches used in this design are relatively new — I think
the first keyboards using them only appeared a year or two ago, and
they are still a rarity in the mechanical keyboard communities. You
can tell by how hard it is to find key caps for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retro Feather — what is more retro than a mechanical keyboard? Those
are the kinds of keyboards that were made for computers back when they
costed more than an airplane and had the computing power of a watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistive Tech — a dedicated macro keyboard such as can be built with
this is an excellent usability- and accessibility-enhancing tool. But
you don’t have to stop there — experiments with chording, durations,
modes, etc. can lead directly to improvements with our current
keyboards and other input devices. You can also use it as a component
in more complex devices — add an accelerometer and you ave an airmouse
with three buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wireless Feather — fine, that’s the second category that doesn’t apply
to this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>The Popcorn Wing</title>
    <updated>2019-11-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I decided to give the tiny keyboard thingy one more try, this
time with solder paste and hot air gun. Turns out those small buttons
have a pretty narrow thermal curve — they get crispy really easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-168395/images/8569211574155781937.jpg" src="projects/project-168395/images/8569211574155781937.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, weren’t they supposed to just magically pop right into their
places, instead of clustering together into a single mega-button?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
