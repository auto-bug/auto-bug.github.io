    <title>New Project, New Plans</title>
    <updated>2016-03-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="new-project-new-plans"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2016-03-23 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-10491/#project-10491"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Lodestar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is what was born from the &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-7663&lt;/span&gt;  experiments. Back then, I assembled a 5×5×5 RGB LED cube by soldering
the NeoPixels directly together, and managed to get some very nice
lightning effects with that. But the soldering job wasn’t very good,
the device was brittle, the LEDs would flicker off at a touch, and the
walls of the cube became somewhat rounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/108021458761550860.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/108021458761550860.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to do a second approach. This time I’m going to solder
the LEDs onto 6 PCBs. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=17614&amp;amp;accesskey=f1f730c997b8961c9ada95dd2be1916b"&gt;I ordered them from DirtyPCBs&lt;/a&gt;  some time ago, and I was lucky, because the proto-pack contains 12
boards – enough to make two cubes! Anyways, I only have enough
NeoPixels to make one for now, but it’s nice to know that I have a
spare. The connections on the board follow what I came up back when I
worked on &lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;project-7663&lt;/span&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/2992871458761711305.png" src="projects/project-10491/images/2992871458761711305.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already tried to solder one board by hand, and I must say it’s hard.
There is so little room between the LEDs, and it’s so hard to keep
them straight… The result is not very pretty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/2670031458762084874.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/2670031458762084874.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would probably look fine if I encased it in a laser-cut box made of
matte acrylic, but still, I think I can do better. So I paused with
the other boards for now, and ordered a solder paste. I will try to
use that together with a hot plate to get better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it about the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the inside, I plan to install an ESP8266 module, together with 3D
compass and GPS modules. And a small LiPo battery, of course. The hope
is that this will let me figure out where in the world the cube is and
how it is oriented, and then animate the lights to point to the next
way-point. We will see how that works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Solderpaste</title>

&lt;p&gt;The solder paste just arrived! Just as I have to leave to catch the
plane to Belgrade. Oh well, next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Desoldering</title>

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2016-04-11 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-10491/#project-10491"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Lodestar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to reflow the board, with extra flux added, to see if that
would help. It didn’t, so I decided to try and recover the LEDs from
the board… And I learned why they use temperature-controlled hot-
plates for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/5757031460367323321.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/5757031460367323321.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is melted plastic from one of the LEDs…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/993801460367351004.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/993801460367351004.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that’s a failure… Good thing I have excellent ventilation in
my kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Soldering</title>
    <updated>2016-04-11T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="soldering"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2016-04-11 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-10491/#project-10491"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Lodestar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m back from the conference, and I finally got to try the
solderpaste that arrived before I left. I just quickly went to a local
pharmacy to buy the thickest needle they had, I cut that needle with a
dremel, and I was ready to go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/823631460365066651.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/823631460365066651.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I applied a small drop of the solderpaste on each of the pads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/459041460365140333.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/459041460365140333.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I carefully placed all the diodes, making sure they are all
aligned properly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/108771460365234379.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/108771460365234379.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to the kitchen and switched the stove on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/2083401460365304220.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/2083401460365304220.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited a bit until the plate got hot, and pushed the board onto it.
Then waited until the solderpaste was properly melting, and pushed the
board off the plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/378551460365424498.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/378551460365424498.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final effect looks good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-10491/images/5705621460365534164.jpg" src="projects/project-10491/images/5705621460365534164.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it doesn’t work. Only one LED ever blinks, and that is only
for a short moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I must have applied too much soldering paste, and there are
some internal shorts of the signal pins. Now I’m thinking about some
way to recover the LEDs – I think I will put the board on the hot
plate again, and pick the LEDs from it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
