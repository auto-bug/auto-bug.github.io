    <title>Making Holes</title>
    <updated>2018-10-18T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="making-holes"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2018-10-18 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-160167/#project-160167"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Electronic Barrette Hub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the PCBs (they might not make it in time after all,
I’m afraid), I’m still working on the faceplates. In order to
correctly place all the holes for the CPX’s LEDs and sensors, I
prepared an image of the PCB with the CPX overlaid on top of it
(lifted from Adafruit’s Fritzing library):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-160167/images/8773341539878635282.png" src="projects/project-160167/images/8773341539878635282.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I printed that on normal paper, and used a knife to cut out all
the places where there is something that needs to be exposed. Then
just align it with the outline of the faceplate, and gently shade the
whole thing with a pencil:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-160167/images/5983731539878730828.jpg" src="projects/project-160167/images/5983731539878730828.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is just a scrollsaw and a dremel tool. You can also see
on this photo the cool purple bolt nuts that I found, to be used to
secure the CPX to the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Working Prototype (kinda)</title>
    <updated>2018-10-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="working-prototype-kinda"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2018-10-20 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-160167/#project-160167"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Electronic Barrette Hub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an estimation for the shipping of the PCBs, and it doesn’t look
good: they will arrive Monday, 3h before the deadline for the prize.
So I decided to go and cobble together a working prototype from what I
have at hand right now. It’s not pretty, but it works, and I can show
off some of the possible uses for such a hub in the video, so it
should be good enough. I will still attempt to assemble and test the
actual prototype as soon as the PCBs arrive, but I can’t promise I
will make the deadline with that, and I will certainly have no time to
shoot the video afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I re-used the PCBs for the Pulse Barrette — the simple blinking LED
prototype that I made initially — and a lot of two-sided tape. I also
used hobby servo plugs for connectors, and only wired two pins (the
final version will use all 8 pins). It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-160167/images/555321540061289708.jpg" src="projects/project-160167/images/555321540061289708.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also updated the BOM and the build instructions. Of course, those
will change as soon as the final prototype is ready, but since I don’t
have the PCBs, I can’t make the photos, etc. — so you have the crappy
prototype instructions for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, it may actually be more fun to build it like this, even if
it looks bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Video and Repository Update</title>
    <updated>2018-10-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="video-and-repository-update"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the deadline, I have now linked the required video
in the project’s metadata, and updated the project repository with the
most recent design files, bill of materials and schematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>What I Hope to Achieve?</title>
    <updated>2018-10-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="what-i-hope-to-achieve"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2018-10-21 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-160167/#project-160167"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Electronic Barrette Hub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s time to talk a little bit about the goals of this project.  On
the face of it, there is really very little creativity in it: it’s
basically just a carrier PCB for the Circuit Playground Express board,
with a battery, charger and some connectors. You can build three
projects like that before breakfast. There is absolutely nothing novel
or revolutionary or technically challenging in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I am not aware of anything like this already
existing, and I am convinced that and existence of something like this
would be extremely useful for a lot of people. Not just for beginners,
who are afraid to try soldering, or designing a PCB like this, but
also experienced wearable builders and cosplayers, who don’t need to
reinvent the wheel every time, and can simply build their stuff around
an already existing design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at, say, Arduino, it wasn’t a “revolutionary” project
either. Every single thing on it has been done before multiple times
and was widely available. But Arduino made it easier for everyone by
bringing those things together in one package, and creating a standard
platform to build on, sharing and re-mixing your designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bare microcontroller board lets you build anything — the
possibilities are infinite, and mind staggers confronted with a blank
page. A base like the Barrette Hub limits your freedom and suggests
what to build — making it much easier to begin, and hopefully bringing
more people into the wonderful world of interactive wearables. Later
on, when you are more experienced, you can leave it for other, more
flexible and universal solutions, but you will probably still come
back when your particular use case is a good fit, and a ready solution
can save you time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it work? Will the platform become popular? Will the idea catch
on? Will it become an actual standard? I have no idea, this is very
much a question of luck and of appearing at just the right time and
place. I believe the right time for this kind of platform is closing
in fast, and I am willing to do the work to give it a try. Time will
tell if it’s a wasted effort or not, but in the worst case I still
learn a lot in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Proper Prototype</title>
    <updated>2018-10-22T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="proper-prototype"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2018-10-22 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-160167/#project-160167"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Electronic Barrette Hub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCBs just arrived from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.io/hacker/131216"&gt;&amp;#64;oshpark &lt;/a&gt; and I finally assembled a proper prototype. I’m quite happy with how
it looks, even without the face plate or any ornaments on the PCB:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-160167/images/1804971540204588238.jpg" src="projects/project-160167/images/1804971540204588238.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I like how the holes covered with the soldermask look
like: inconspicious. I used staggered holes for the connectors, which
means that you can simply insert male pin headers into them — you can
see one inserted in the top right corner. That really lets me hide
them from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five connectors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-160167/images/7089001540204735865.jpg" src="projects/project-160167/images/7089001540204735865.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four for general purpose GPIO pins, with two pins on each, also
doubling for UART and I2C communication, and one for USB, for those
devices (like the &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-158701/#project-158701"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Video Pendant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ) which are too small to fit an USB port, but still need USB
communication. The power on the USB port is stabilized 3.3V, while the
remaining ports are connected to the battery directly, because they
are likely to need all the power they can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do some more testing with those connectors, and if they don’t
work well enough, I will solder either female pin headers, or grove
sockets in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the build instructions and parts list are now
updated, and there is a bunch of new photos. Unfortunately I won’t
have time to update the video, but the basic functionality shown there
remains the same (well, except for the battery charging, but that’s a
boring thing to watch).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be working on the ornaments and the face plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
