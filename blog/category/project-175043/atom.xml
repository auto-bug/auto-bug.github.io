    <title>Original Layout</title>
    <updated>2020-10-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="original-layout"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2020-10-24 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-175043/#project-175043"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Flatreus Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the project tested and working, I added the gerbers
and Fritzing design to the files, so that other can also build it. It
uses the bootloader and CircuitPython firmware for &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-171381/#project-171381"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Fluff M0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , and I added an example with the original Atreus layout to the ukeeb
library: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb/blob/main/examples/flatreus.py"&gt;https://github.com/deshipu/ukeeb/blob/main/examples/flatreus.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s that layout, taken from the Atreus kickstarter page. Of course
you can easily modify it for your own tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scissors…</title>
    <updated>2020-11-20T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="scissors"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2020-11-20 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-175043/#project-175043"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Flatreus Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this project is finished and works fine. But I recently found in my
drawer those Kailh scissor switches that I ordered a year ago to test,
and forgot about them. So why not test them by making another Atreus-
like keyboard? This switch of course has different footprint again,
and with a hole in the PCB too, so a new design for the PCB is called
for. And since I don’t like to do the same thing twice, I removed the
column stagger this time, and only included two keys in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/8883901605828094532.png" src="projects/project-175043/images/8883901605828094532.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also need the special key caps for this. Kailh has some super-
ugly ones, but that will do for now, I suppose. As usual, the PCB is
ordered and should arrive within a week or two, then I can assemble it
all and try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Can we go Flatter?</title>
    <updated>2020-12-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="can-we-go-flatter"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2020-12-06 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-175043/#project-175043"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Flatreus Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kailh scoissors and keycaps arrived, and I mostly assembled this
small keyboard, which I tentatively dubbed Edward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/2158551607279764858.jpg" src="projects/project-175043/images/2158551607279764858.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’m still missing a few switches in there, they will arrive in a
separate package.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how are the switches? Honestly, not great. On the positive side,
they are really low. Like, this is Edward against Kamina, which is my
everyday low-profile keyboard now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/8638211607279893431.jpg" src="projects/project-175043/images/8638211607279893431.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key travel is 2mm, compared to the 3mm of the choc switches, and
because of the way the spring is attached in there, you are bottoming
out every single time. The keys are supposed to be clicky, but they
are only sometimes — because of the way the click bar is constructed,
and huge play between the “stem” and the switch case, this is
completely random. For the same reason the contact is not very
reliable, and some of the switches are basically stuck in the always
open or always closed position. It seems like they have pretty bad QE
problems with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I soldered and re-soldered parts to make sure the problems are
indeed with the switches and not with my soldering, I accidentally got
one of the switches too close to the hot air gun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/3236411607280607993.jpg" src="projects/project-175043/images/3236411607280607993.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fused the transparent “scissors” together, making the switch
unusable, so I decided to disassemble it, to see what makes it…
click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from and interesting rocker mechanism for the spring, the
scissors and the “stem”, there are two separate mechanisms inside for
the click bar and the contacts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/7356481607280718276.jpg" src="projects/project-175043/images/7356481607280718276.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the blue stem has quite a lot of leeway on the sides,
so it’s possible for it to not touch the click bar or the contacts at
all, in extreme cases — that is what makes the switch so unreliable.
Apart from better tolerances I can’t think about any workaround to
make it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Edward keyboard is very cute and small, super-thin,
but too unreliable to be practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Small Improvements</title>
    <updated>2021-04-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="small-improvements"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2021-04-01 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-175043/#project-175043"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Flatreus Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some small improvements to the Flatreus recently. I replaced
the tact switches I originally used for the mouse buttons with actual
switches for a mouse. They require much less actuation force, and are
much more clicky. They feel exactly right, even though they are a bit
harder to reach due to being lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/6225441617289105308.jpg" src="projects/project-175043/images/6225441617289105308.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I’m using leftover keycaps with it now. They fit
surprisingly well my new layout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/5888231617289243875.png" src="projects/project-175043/images/5888231617289243875.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was originally designed for a smaller keyboard, so 8 keys are
unused, but they were hard to reach anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Electra</title>
    <updated>2021-09-08T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="electra"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2021-09-08 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-175043/#project-175043"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Flatreus Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first built Flatreus, it seemed pretty nice, but way too small
for me. I wasn’t yet used to using layers, and I wanted to at least
have all the navigation and control keys (Esc, Enter, Backspace, Del,
etc.) easily accessible. So I designed a version of Flatreus with an
extra column of keys added on each side. The idea was to make it work
more like a Planck or &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-174917/#project-174917"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Dorsch 48k Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . I ordered the PCBs, but I never assembled them, because by the time
they arrived I was already experimenting with &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-175712/#project-175712"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Kamina Keyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , and moved on from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I impulse-bought some Kailh Purpz switches (there is a sale
on Aliexpress), and wanted to try them on something — so I dug out the
PCBs and finally assembled them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/8535551631135673357.jpg" src="projects/project-175043/images/8535551631135673357.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course in the mean time I learned a lot more about layers and
minimalist keyboards, and I figured out a system for making my own
layout on any new keyboard. So the layout I ended up with is a bit
different than I initially had in mind when designing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/897791631135777909.png" src="projects/project-175043/images/897791631135777909.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the keychron keycaps, because I have them lying around all the
time, since they are so bad, that I always replace them with something
else whenever I can. The switches are pretty nice — they are linears
with 25g springs, very light in touch. Switching back to my Kamina
with clicky Choc Whites makes me really feel how strong I have to push
on the keys! Of course, as always, there is a trade-off: it’s much
easier to make mistakes and typos on the lighter switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-175043/images/8736971631135948794.jpg" src="projects/project-175043/images/8736971631135948794.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I’m pretty happy with this one, and I’m using it to type
right now, just for some variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
