    <title>Assembly</title>
    <updated>2023-09-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="assembly"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-09-12 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-192761/#project-192761"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Astro-chan Badge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boards arrived today, and I assembled one. Well, partially, since
I don’t have the resistors for the I2C pullups on the accelerometer
yet, and the battery holders should arrive tomorrow…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/9697001694474628274.jpg" src="projects/project-192761/images/9697001694474628274.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the display working with CircuitPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/9059021694474692551.jpg" src="projects/project-192761/images/9059021694474692551.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went ahead and used the gifio module for directly displaying
animated gifs on the display. I think I need to simplify the graphics
a bit if I want to be able to produce several matching animations for
the different accelerometer movements, but I’m getting close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/2249201694474790261.jpg" src="projects/project-192761/images/2249201694474790261.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course you could also just put your avatar on the display and call
it a day, maybe add some rotation for accelerometer reactions…&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Design</title>
    <updated>2023-09-12T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="design"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-09-12 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-192761/#project-192761"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Astro-chan Badge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with EasyEDA for the design, because I’m trying to move away
from Fritzing, but I still can’t stand KiCad. Plus I get all those
footprints for free. The basic PCB was done in a single evening. I
drew the body using a graphic tablet, imported it as the silkscreen
layer, and made the board outline and all the rest manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/174701694474181953.png" src="projects/project-192761/images/174701694474181953.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to figure out the positions of all the components
on the back, especially the battery and the Xiao module. Initially I
tried to use a coin cell battery, but the people on the badgelife
discord talked me out of it. I ended up with a 14250 lipo battery, and
I put the battery holder over the module, so that it can act as a
backpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/3064251694474360015.png" src="projects/project-192761/images/3064251694474360015.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronics wise there is the display, the Xiao module, the battery
with a power switch, two LEDs on the gun, and a LIS3DH accelerometer
chip. Oh, and a transistor to do power switching between USB and
battery, but since I plan to use the Xiao ESP32-S3, that already comes
with its own power circuit and battery charging, I will just short the
pins on the footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>First Animation</title>
    <updated>2023-09-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="first-animation"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-09-13 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-192761/#project-192761"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Astro-chan Badge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few days to decide on the style I want the image to be.
On one hand I want it to be a cute astronaut girl, but on the other
hand I want to keep it as simple as possible, so that I can animate it
easily, and so that it’s recognizable from a distance. After some
experimenting with different techniques and programs, and looking at
different cartoons, I finally decided on a style that is inspired by
the Swiss Familienwagen decorations. It’s very cartoonish and simple,
but stil pretty cute. I got the first, easiest animation done:
blinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/9977361694641928532.gif" src="projects/project-192761/images/9977361694641928532.gif" /&gt;

    <title>Missing Components</title>
    <updated>2023-09-19T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="missing-components"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-09-19 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-192761/#project-192761"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Astro-chan Badge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I finally added all the missing components: the resistor for the
backlight, the accelerometer with its i2c pull-ups, and the two red
LEDs on the gun, with their matching resistors as well. I was waiting
for the right sized resistors to arrive from LCSC, but they seem to be
stuck at the airport for the last three weeks, so I squeezed the
bigger resistors I have in those footprints instead. I also improved
the idle animation a bit, adding random eye movements and improving
the timing of the blinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/9565751695115469391.gif" src="projects/project-192761/images/9565751695115469391.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I need to figure out how to process the data from the
accelerometer to make it detect the events that will trigger different
animations. And of course to draw all those different animations. It
will probably take a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Second Animation and Accelerometer</title>
    <updated>2023-09-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="second-animation-and-accelerometer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-09-30 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-192761/#project-192761"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Astro-chan Badge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a little bit of time today, so I quickly made a second animation
for this badge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-192761/images/8857511696110288975.gif" src="projects/project-192761/images/8857511696110288975.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added the code to read the raw x, y, and z values from the
accelerometer, and play this animation if the x component is greater
than 5000 – which basically means that the badge is tilted to the
left. Of course adding a similar animation for the right tilt is
trivial. I also want to make a “stunned” animation, to be displayed
after the board has been shaken – but to detect that I will need to
keep some previous values and calculate the variance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
