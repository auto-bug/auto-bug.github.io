    <title>Material Alternatives</title>
    <updated>2023-06-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-06-02 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-191383/#project-191383"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Bigbug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After building and testing the robot, I have some changes to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/3509411685666994451.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/3509411685666994451.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the plywood I used is not great for the legs.
Surprisingly, it’s not the weight of the robot resting on them that is
the issue, but the fact that the parts twist, especially when the
robot tilts from side to side to unload its leg before raising it, and
the whole thing becomes rather wobbly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what are the alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go with stronger plywood (the one I used was sold together
with my scrollsaw, and is rather soft), and perhaps laser-cut it this
time. Or I could go with laser-cut acrylic like in Fluffbug, it should
still be stronger than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or I could really go all the way, and use 2.5mm aluminium sheet. It’s
soft enough to cut by hand with a hacksaw, and should give me plenty
of strength. I’m tempted to do it, especially if I can cut it at the
hackerspace and avoid the mess at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, I think I will also need to make the legs a little
shorter. I was optimistic and really scaled them 200%, but that makes
the robot look really tall and narrow, and doesn’t help with
stability. Shorter legs should make it easier to fine tune the gait,
no matter what they are made of, and this is not a race, so I don’t
really worry about the speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <updated>2023-07-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="edward-knifelegs"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2023-07-05 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-191383/#project-191383"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Bigbug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2.5mm aluminium sheet arrived, and I spent a weekend sawing it
with a hacksaw and drilling by hand and with an electric drill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/3087341688509132197.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/3087341688509132197.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you plan on doing anything similar yourself, I have two tips for
you. Get the sheet attached to something heavy securely, a good vise
or clamps can speed up your sawing greatly, and don’t arrange the
parts the way I did in there, interlocking, without a straight sawing
line separating them. It’s much easier if you can separate the
elements with straight cuts first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/7333191688509353984.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/7333191688509353984.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then some drilling and a lot of filing, and we have workable legs.
Note that it vaguely resembles a knife, mostly because it’s made of
shiny metal. But all the edges are rounded, and the tip is not sharp
either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/5169841688509459147.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/5169841688509459147.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished robot. Yes, it does look like hacked by hand, and it would
look much more “finished” if I used a cnc machine or some kind of
other cutting service. But I happen to be happy with that looks, and I
don’t plan on making more than this one prototype. I added some RGB
LEDs to act as eyes, but they are not connected to anything right now.
If I ever replace the wooden body with a custom PCB, I will probably
include footprints for those LEDs and connect them to spare pins, but
for now I haven’t decided if I will ever go for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/3320581688509652442.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/3320581688509652442.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a family photo of all three bug robots: &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-188909/#project-188909"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Wee Bug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-180025/#project-180025"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Fluffbug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Bigbug all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>Version Two</title>
    <updated>2024-06-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="version-two"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2024-06-20 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-191383/#project-191383"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Bigbug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robot was built to see if it would work, and I have to say that it
worked pretty well so far. However, after taking it to several
different events, I now have some ideas about how to improve it for
such events specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem I have is that the robot is really to slow to walk
around with it. As such, it’s mostly spending its time on the time,
waiting to be switched on for a few steps to show to the passing
people, and switched off before it falls off the table. Its size is
also a bit awkward. It’s too big to really do anything useful on the
table, but too small to be safe from being trampled on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I want to build a second version, using faster servos and
longer legs. That should solve both the problems. I also want to try
and make the body look less like a bunch of duct-taped garbage, but
that’s a secondary consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have the servos for the second version. I went with the JX
PDI-6208MG, mostly because they are roughly the same size as the MG995
I used in the first version, but should be about twice as fast. I also
got some aluminium cases to see if I can use them as the body. One
such case seems to be particularly suitable, so I went ahead and cut
some holes in it to mount the servos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/970631718834962094.JPG" src="projects/project-191383/images/970631718834962094.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting thick aluminium with a dremel turned out to be harder than I
anticipated, but with some struggle, I got all four holes for the
servo, and the accompanying mounting holes done, and then painted the
enclosure with black spray paint to make all the scratches less
obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/4597261718835314447.JPG" src="projects/project-191383/images/4597261718835314447.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the legs, I was planning to cut them from 3mm sheet aluminium
again, but then I realized that some of the usual PCB fabs also let
you order CNC cut parts. Initially I tried three of them, but with the
pricing they showed, I started preparing the hacksaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/1935491718835442162.JPG" src="projects/project-191383/images/1935491718835442162.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I thought about the fact that they also do bead-blasting and
anodizing of the parts. I imagined nice red anodized aluminium legs,
and I went to try some more fabs. One of the offered to make the parts
for 1/3 of the price of the others, and that is acceptable for me for
a one-off project, so I ended up ordering the parts anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wanted step files, so I took this opportunity to learn to use
FreeCAD a little bit…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/704231718835566061.png" src="projects/project-191383/images/704231718835566061.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, this is horrible. But it’s the step file that counts
in the end. With the leg parts ordered and scheduled to arrive in some
two weeks, I got to work on the electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need anything too fancy here. I wanted to use the pi pico, to
have enough extra pins for things like speakers, blinking LEDs, extra
moving parts and so on. I considered using a 3S lipo battery pack, but
it’s considerably heavier than the 2 18650 batteries I used
previously, so I kept those. I looked at the buck converter chips
available, but I didn’t find anything that would be much better than
just using a ready buck module, so I just left holes to connect that.
The rest is simple: power switch, servo sockets, and a shottky diode
for the pi pico VSYS (I might replace it with a different diode with a
larger voltage drop, to raise the voltage for the servos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/4118001718836070859.png" src="projects/project-191383/images/4118001718836070859.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case, I made the PCB shaped just like the body of the robot in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-188909/#project-188909"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Wee Bug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-180025/#project-180025"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Fluffbug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , so that if the aluminium case proves to be too heavy or otherwise
problematic, I can revert to the taped garbage looks. I moved the
batteries to both sides of the PCB to make the weight more evenly
distributed, and I added a bunch of break-off parts for attaching the
servos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with the PCB and the leg parts on order, all we have to do is
wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>The PCB Body</title>
    <updated>2024-06-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="the-pcb-body"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2024-06-24 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-191383/#project-191383"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Bigbug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCBs arrived (is it just me or are they really getting faster
recently?) today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/1569411719257885095.JPG" src="projects/project-191383/images/1569411719257885095.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I assembled one, just to see how it all fits together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/9389941719257946353.JPG" src="projects/project-191383/images/9389941719257946353.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the fact that the switch works in reverse (on is down),
everything is pretty much as expected. I used nylon screws to save a
bit on on weight (and because they are black and look better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m only waiting for the legs. They should be fabricated next
week, and we will see if they arrive before I travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

    <title>The Legs</title>
    <updated>2024-07-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;section id="the-legs"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published on 2024-07-03 in &lt;a class="reference internal" href="../../../projects/project-191383/#project-191383"&gt;&lt;span class="std std-ref"&gt;Bigbug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while (because I picked the cheap and slow option), but the
leg parts finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/6053351720028992851.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/6053351720028992851.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They look great: 3mm thick anodized aluminium. Very solid and pretty
light too. So I assembled the robot with the PCB body first, just to
see how it all looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/1759941720029078902.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/1759941720029078902.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that those servos are really beefy. In fact, they are so
strong and fast, that my lazy code, which tells them too move from one
end to the other when making a step, makes them draw so much current
that the 8/15A regulator shuts down. This is more of a software
problem, though, than hardware — the power is perfectly adequate when
the servos are moving more gradually and don’t make sudden movements
all at once. There is also a problem that I already noticed in the
first version of Big Bug, that is even more pronounced now with the
longer legs — the robot is tilted to one side for some reason. I
initially thought that it’s because the servos have asymmetric
response to the PWM signal, moving faster in one direction than in the
other, but then the difference would be between diagonal legs, and
it’s clearly a left/right asymmetry. I will need to investigate that
closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the initial tests done, I proceeded to move the robot to its
proper aluminium body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/7773551720029405627.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/7773551720029405627.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used one more spare PCB from the PCB body, but I cut off the
mechanical part to which the servos were attached, so that it will fit
inside the case better. I also experimented with several different
buck converters, but in the end settled on the 8/16A one that I used
initially. I ordered a few more to try later, too, so I might still
change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total weight of the whole robot is just shy of 1kg, which is not
too bad. I might actually make it even less by replacing the case lids
with PCBs (I don’t feel like drilling all the holes for the power
switch and USB in the original lids), and using a smaller battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drilled the holes on the sides for the servo cables, added some
plastic cable management thingies, wrapped some rubber strings on the
feet, and closed the lid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="projects/project-191383/images/8654621720029703398.jpg" src="projects/project-191383/images/8654621720029703398.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all that is remaining is, as always, programming. And waiting for
the additional parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
